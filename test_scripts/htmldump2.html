The latest iteration of “Forbidden Broadway,” Gerard Alessandrini’s long-running satirical revue, will move to the York Theater Company at Saint Peter’s for an extended engagement following the close of its production at the Triad Theater on Sunday, the company has announced. Performances at the new space will begin on Jan. 15, 2020. The first run of Alessandrini’s franchise opened Off Broadway in 1982, skewering the Broadway shows and stars of the day. It has since become a theatrical institution, evolving over more than three decades to lampoon the latest casting choices, musical numbers and corporate-minded producers. The franchise has earned  Alessandrini a Tony Honor for Excellence in Theater, an Obie Award and a number of Drama Desk Awards. Its current edition, “Forbidden Broadway: The Next Generation,” opened at the Triad in October, and features spoofs on the recent “Oklahoma!” revival, “Moulin Rouge” and “Dear Evan Hansen” with sketches like “Woke-lahoma!” and “Dear Evan Has-Been.” The New York Times theater critics Ben Brantley and Jesse Green designated the production a Critic’s Pick in their joint review, with Green writing that the show is “not just an excuse for mockery but also an opportunity for reflection.” The current show, which was written and directed by Alessandrini, has a cast that includes Immanuel Houston, Aline Mayagoitia, Chris Collins-Pisano, Jenny Lee Stern and Joshua Turchin, with Fred Barton at the piano. Gerry McIntyre choreographed the production. The return engagement is being presented in association with John Freedson, Harriet Yellin, Peter Brash, David Zippel and Alessandrini, with Tzili Charney. “Transferring the show from a tiny cabaret space to a legitimate theater gives us much-needed breathing room, as well as a chance to expand the choreography and add some sparkling lighting,” Alessandrini said in a statement. He added that the move will also give him “the chance to add some new spoofs on the current theater season.” The engagement will run through Feb. 9, 2020. Tickets will be available starting on Dec. 6.
