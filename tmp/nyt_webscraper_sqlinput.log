2021-02-14T18:38:29.635Z - articleBody received: guaynabo p.r victor manuel torres raised one hand about waist level indicating how high the sea rose in his house during hurricane maria last year then with his other hand he lifted a rusty machete at 77 he has lived for more than half a century in a barrio called vietnam abutting san juan harbor for nearly as long municipal authorities have tried to evict him this is how i have held them back he told me waving the machete the storm was a passing shower compared to what we have survived here today numbering some 250 families vietnam began like many barrios in puerto rico laborers lured from the countryside during the island’s postwar industrial boom established a squatters settlement the harbor was a bustling site of factories military bases and jobs but nobody had supplied housing for workers so the workers did it themselves they cleared a swath of mosquito-infested mangroves and cobbled together what were at first rickety shacks that sank time and again in the mud and rain when the shacks didn’t collapse on their own the police would come and tear the houses down hoping to force residents out the pattern continued even as the houses became cinder block and concrete and the settlement grew into a neighborhood by the 1970s the quagmire of conflict gave rise to the name vietnam for residents it became a badge of honor now as the federal government prepares to spend an unprecedented 20 billion to repair neighborhoods across puerto rico that were ravaged by the category 4 storm the goal of finally replacing vietnam’s besieged warren of cinder block houses with a flourishing community capable of weathering the hurricanes of the future seems at once more urgent and less likely than ever the reasons have to do with basic concepts like home and safety things that might seem straightforward but are not so easily defined here much of the island’s population lives in areas like this one that are vulnerable to floods and landslides thanks to the historical patchwork of homes built and exchanged informally across generations nearly half of all residents according to studies lack the clear titles to their properties that would allow them to take out housing reconstruction loans sell their properties legally and move to safer neighborhoods with crippling debt and a poverty rate that is double mississippi’s puerto rico has tried to resolve these problems on its own for years without success the billions set to be spent by the federal department of housing and urban development in the coming months for an island where more than 90,000 homes were destroyed represents the largest such grant in the history of federal disaster relief efforts hoping to make the most of it puerto rico’s governor has come up with the outlines of a proposal for new development across the 110-mile-long island the proposal promises nobody will be forced to move but there’s a catch because of federal regulations those living in flood-prone areas won’t be given any public money unless their homes comply with flood-protection standards complying with regulations that require elevating houses employing licensed contractors providing wheelchair access and using only certain materials can be just too costly for many puerto ricans more costly than the value of their homes this means hundreds of thousands living in barrios like vietnam will not get assistance as an alternative they will be offered titles to free new apartments elsewhere if they are available the plan is vague it wagers that provided with enough incentives for-profit developers will build the necessary housing and infrastructure bringing crucial jobs with them but that’s a gamble over the last century puerto rico has produced landmark social housing projects like el falansterio in san juan an art deco-detailed waterfront complex from the 1930s that all these years later remains a thriving community and a model of elegant humane design unfortunately anyone who knows about rising construction costs the island’s crippled bureaucracy and its legacy of failed projects and the federal government’s looming deadlines for spending reconstruction money also knows that the only things that may actually end up getting built are sprawling quasi-suburban projects on cheap shovel-ready agricultural land uncoordinated with services and transit and also a bunch of luxury hotels and condo towers on the coast the system favors cheap and quick solutions said federico del monte president of the puerto rican planning society omar marrero who runs puerto rico’s central office of recovery reconstruction and resiliency demurred while acknowledging the problems we will try to keep communities intact he said but to the extent the legal requirements don’t allow us to use federal dollars families will have to decide whether they want to remain where they are carmen chévere ortiz has decided already she became accustomed over the years to floods in villa calma an informal working-class community near the northern coast of the island that lies below sea level but maria was different she told me the other day the area was swamped in minutes by what seemed to her like a tidal wave that suddenly swept away houses and cars we lost everything ms chévere said now i just want to get out of here as fast as possible on the other hand many islanders in similar predicaments like mr torres won’t want to leave free apartment or not that’s because security or what is also called resilience in the context of climate change and natural disasters entails more than just high ground and a sturdy roof in struggling places where people feeling they cannot rely on the authorities count on each other safety comes down to community it is why many residents of the lower ninth ward in new orleans where dozens drowned during hurricane katrina in 2005 fought tooth and nail to stay put notwithstanding that the neighborhood is a giant bathtub or why indonesians in shanties crowding sewage-filled canals went to court in jakarta to sue the authorities for moving them into new apartment towers miles away people usually opt to preserve their communities and ties to the land even if it means living in harm’s way points out eric klinenberg a sociologist at n.y.u whose specialty is social resilience they have seen enough projects go wrong to suspect that they’re better off risking the next big storm and staying home where at least they have friends and family nearby carmen ayendez who lived in vietnam much of her life said her father four years ago took up the government’s offer of a new home in sunset harbor one of three housing projects built by the municipality of guaynabo vietnam straddles guaynabo a mostly prosperous district outside san juan and the adjacent municipality of cataño with the purpose of relocating vietnam’s residents when her father died two days after signing the new lease ms ayendez took over the house but shortly after moving she started waking in the night unable to breathe it turned out the new house was plagued by mold ms ayendez hasn’t been able to get rid of it when maria hit her roof cracked she was supposed to be safer in sunset harbor i preferred living in vietnam she said i built my own house there on a piece of land that my dad gave me when i was 19 it was a wooden house it had bats and worms but not mold i had my friends and neighbors the roof wasn’t very secure but it was home to protect its residents from evictions and gentrification san juan’s largest barrio on the banks of the martín peña canal has been operating as a community land trust for some years it ensures everyone in the barrio has rights a stake and a say the trust has negotiated voluntary relocations where the clogged polluted and frequently overflowing canal needs to be dredged or widened and homes get in the way evelyn quiñones 63 one of the community’s leaders showed me the house she agreed to move to a few years ago on a street just outside the barrio the decision to leave wasn’t easy she said it made all the difference that the choice to move was hers the new house was in good shape and that her relocation improved conditions for people inside the barrio i return to the old neighborhood every day she said the new house is bigger and i feel safe there but these are not my people through the generations the community of vietnam has similarly bonded over its common enemies meager resources and views of the harbor which have also insured that moneyed interests continue scheming during the early 2000s the mayor of guaynabo in league with developers started expropriating properties to make way for luxury villas neighbors banded together sued and won just because you don’t have a title to your property and you are poor doesn’t mean the government shouldn’t work with you to improve your neighborhood said carmen yulín cruz san juan’s mayor she worries about the current approach so does ricardo lvarez-díaz former president of the puerto rico builders association my fear is we will build houses for the sake of building houses where people don’t want to live he said people don’t just need houses they need communities the hurricane proved this it was the communities not fema he added referring to the federal emergency management agency that saved most people after hurricane maria mr torres replaced the zinc roof that blew off his home in vietnam a stack of bamboo washed ashore during the storm and he used it to fashion a chair now perched on his patio facing the harbor he said he would gladly accept money from the federal government to fortify his house but with or without it he’s content just to sit in his chair and watch the sun set over the harbor he is not moving dead is the only way they will ever get me to leave he said maybe not even then alejandra rosa contributed reporting from san juan p.r

2021-02-14T18:38:29.741Z - articleBody received: washington hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work on monday with a presidential promise of a paycheck very quickly but no guarantee that they will be working in three weeks when a temporary stopgap of funding expires president trump and congressional democrats arrived at a short-term agreement late on friday reopening the government after 35 days and the longest government shutdown in history lawmakers have until feb 15 to reach a compromise on the republican request for billions of dollars to be allocated for a border wall a wall democrats have refused to fund referring to the odds that a deal could be struck over that time mr trump told the wall street journal on sunday i personally think it’s less than 50-50 mr trump said he would use emergency powers to fund the wall if an agreement could not be reached in a stark reminder that federal employees were returning to work with the knowledge that they might be forced to go without a paycheck once again next month one federal agency the department of agriculture updated its employee information website and said we will also leave some of the shutdown-related material up for a period time should you need to refer back to it richard nagle a lawyer with the environmental protection agency in chicago said returning to work after a mandatory furlough required some digging out it’s triage he said eyeing his email inbox i’m going to go through the ones that are screaming for attention i haven’t been on voice mail yet but i’m sure that’s capped out at 32 messages in the first hour of his day one question seemed to be echoing through the halls what did you do colleagues were sharing stories of how they passed the time while they were furloughed pretty much everyone confessed to sleeping a little later than usual basements were cleaned out digital photos were organized hardwood floors were scrubbed until they were gleaming some employees took road trips visiting extended family in michigan or driving down to memphis eight hours away anything to stave off the boredom and anxiety of being home unpaid during a chicago winter as employees streamed into the office managers stood in the lobby handing out informational papers on things to know how to apply for back pay what to do if you forgot your passwords some supervisors brought in sweet treats there were nudges about projects that had been put on hold and in some cases forgotten and hurried meetings to figure out what could be accomplished before the next potential shutdown at a federal emergency management agency office in fort worth some employees felt like they were racing against the clock they’re trying to get as much work as they can get done before flood season tornado season and hurricane season said steve reaves a safety officer for fema who also leads the union for fema employees with us it’s do as much we can before they try to do this again senior officials on monday both welcomed their workforces and tried to reassure them about the weeks to come i encourage you all to take time to talk to each other about the past few weeks and be transparent with your supervisors about any hardships brock long the fema administrator wrote in an email on monday morning i also want to be clear that there is no higher priority than to guarantee for those who missed paychecks that you get paid as quickly as possible but mr long acknowledged that reopening the government was not as simple as turning a light switch while there is important work to be done i want to make sure that you are set up for success before jumping into your normal assignments he wrote please allow time for updates and reboots to computers addressing expired passwords syncing mobile devices managing benefits and organizing your work space supervisors have been provided checklists that should be helpful again please also take the time to listen and support each other ryan baugh a department of homeland security statistician and a steward for the american federation of government employees said the possibility that there could be another shutdown had a damaging effect raising questions about what could realistically be scheduled meetings trainings projects given the uncertainty we’ll work hard for three weeks and then we’ll see what happens he said you could still use the word hostage we’re still the bargaining chip here the morning commute on monday in the washington area was once again bustling after an eerily quiet month of little road traffic during peak travel hours and open seats on trains and buses at a metro station near the environmental protection agency’s headquarters in washington a small group of environmental activists with the nonprofit group mom’s clean air force welcomed e.p.a employees back to work with cinnamon rolls welcome back cinnamon roll elizabeth brandt a field organizer for the group chirped as employees rode up the metro escalator ms brandt holding her daughters valencia 5 and natalia 3 said that having grown up next to a toxic cleanup site in tacoma wash it was important to her to make sure the agency’s workers knew their work was valued i don’t often get a chance to thank people who do that work the way i thank our pediatrician and the people who give my kids shots she said e.p.a employees for their part said they were relieved to be back to work yet anxious that the reprieve from the partial government shutdown could be short-lived most of us cannot afford to be without pay for a month said denise walker an agency lawyer it’s very stressful for people the national park service reopened on sunday but prospective visitors were encouraged to check with individual parks to make sure they were indeed receiving visitors smithsonian museums and the national zoo were set to reopen on tuesday federal workers who had turned to food banks to feed their families continued to struggle to make ends meet as they returned to work on monday some federal employees have been working without pay for weeks and many federal contractors are not expected to be paid at all for the days the government was closed jamie rodny an investigator at the housing and urban development office in los angeles said she was both excited to return to work and scared she would be facing the same situation in three weeks she was told she would not see a paycheck on monday and said her branch chief told her that he had heard they might get paid on thursday ms rodny who works for the fair housing and equal opportunity division which oversees the enforcement of federal housing laws said she arrived at her office to find frantic emails and voice mail messages from people whose cases she was forced to drop when the government closed now as she returns these messages she expects to hear that some of those complainants were evicted over the past 35 days or are facing debts because of the forced lull in their cases where do i start she asked ms rodny spoke at the women’s march in washington earlier this month after she was approached by her labor union the national federation of federal employees about the financial and emotional pain of workers affected by the shutdown her family lives paycheck to paycheck she said and during the break in pay they used their credit cards for as many purchases as possible which resulted in her credit score dropping she said they were able to make their mortgage payment because of donations they received through a gofundme campaign she recently started an activist group called stop government shutdowns forever the president promised the 800,000 employees who had been furloughed or forced to work that they would be paid very quickly or as soon as possible without providing a specific date the white house office of management and budget directed agencies to prioritize pay and benefits after reopening some federal agencies worked through the weekend in an effort to get paychecks to their workers as soon as possible the department of agriculture instructed its employees to file their time sheets by noon on monday and pledged to resume direct deposits into bank accounts by thursday on sunday the commissioner of the customs and border protection agency kevin k mcaleenan addressed employees on twitter to say that the agency had already approved a majority of the timecards and pledged to work to make sure everyone is paid soon aware of the looming feb 15 deadline some lawmakers are trying to pass a law that would outlaw future government shutdowns shutting down the government should be as off limits in budget negotiations as chemical warfare is in real warfare senator lamar alexander republican of tennessee said on friday

2021-02-14T18:38:29.962Z - articleBody received: renault nissan and mitsubishi on their own aren’t among the top handful of the world’s auto manufacturers together in a unique alliance however they outmatch the sales of giant automakers like volkswagen but the happy confederation has been threatened since its leader carlos ghosn was arrested on suspicion of financial wrongdoing he’s no longer in power and sits in a tokyo jail cell mr ghosn personified the alliance drawing together disparate auto cultures by the force of his personality can it survive without him a leadership vacuum has opened since mr ghosn’s arrest without their longtime leader renault and nissan have blamed each other for trying to tip the balance of power the french government which holds a 15 percent stake in renault has weighed in with concerns that nissan is maneuvering to prevent renault from participating in the alliance’s decision-making mr ghosn and greg kelly an aide who was also arrested occupied seats on the nissan board but nissan had declined a request to hold an immediate shareholder meeting meaning the french carmaker cannot replace its representatives there on thursday nissan said a meeting would be held in april the grouping gives the three companies scale allowing them to operate as one large group with sales that dwarf those of other carmakers the alliance sold 10.6 million cars in 2017 compared with the 10.1 million sold by volkswagen and under nine million vehicles by toyota renault and nissan teamed up in 1999 to share purchasing and design expertise they acted as one entity with mr ghosn at the helm but did not formally merge mitsubishi joined in 2016 and the alliance has worked with the german carmaker daimler on projects like the mercedes-benz pickup truck and the production of compact cars renault owns a 43 percent stake in nissan while nissan has a 15 percent share in renault without voting rights renault exercised more power than the other carmakers in the alliance but nissan sold more cars the situation stirred resentment on the nissan side the japanese carmaker saw renault as unfairly piggybacking on nissan’s technology research and brand renault for its part accused mr ghosn of favoring the japanese and nissan and blocking the french manufacturer’s expansion into china the world’s largest car market to help nissan mr ghosn was trying to push renault and nissan to cooperate further proposing to save 5.7 billion with more coordinated design and manufacturing his plan involved having all vehicles produced by the automakers be based on four combinations of chassis engines and transmissions the nissan-renault alliance was seen as innovative early on but now the auto industry is facing technological disruption companies are realizing that joining forces with rivals may be the only way to compete and cut costs in developing electric and autonomous cars ford and volkswagen announced an alliance this month to speed the development of electric and self-driving cars until recently fiat chrysler itself the result of a merger of carmakers that dates to 2014 has been upfront about its desire to merge with another big carmaker it has been working with bmw since 2017 to develop self-driving cars daimler and bmw have merged their car-sharing businesses to compete with the efforts of companies like uber and alphabet google’s parent company and a number of car companies have working with technology companies such as volvo which provided the chassis for driverless car tests by uber nissan quickly dumped him as head of its board renault had been waiting for mr ghosn to be released on bail but court decisions have kept him jailed in japan and the french carmaker has decided to move on jean-dominique senard the chief executive of the french tire maker michelin and a veteran businessman was named chairman of renault thierry bollor renault’s chief operating officer was named chief executive renault said it planned to supervise the functioning of the alliance but it is unclear whether anyone can fill mr ghosn’s role as its head the partnership is considered essential to the success of these automakers industry experts believe the carmakers are in desperate need of a strong leader the companies in the partnership are facing falling demand in the world’s biggest markets china the united states and europe and rising challenges with the emergence of electric cars and they are grappling with the effect of a trade war on their supply chains ollivier lemal the managing director in france for eim a management consulting firm said the group needed someone who is going to devote all his time and energy to restore dialogue between the manufacturers

2021-02-14T18:38:30.398Z - articleBody received: caracas venezuela on jan 23 61 years after the vicious dictator marcos pérez jiménez was ousted venezuelans once again gathered for a day of democratic celebration pérez jiménez was fraudulently elected by a constituent assembly in 1953 his term of office was scheduled to expire in 1958 but rather than calling for free and transparent presidential elections he was undemocratically re-elected after holding a plebiscite on his administration late in 1957 following widespread protests and a rupture within the military establishment the dictator left the country and venezuela regained its freedom on jan 23 1958 once again we face the challenge of restoring our democracy and rebuilding the country this time amid a humanitarian crisis and the illegal retention of the presidency by nicolás maduro there are severe medicine and food shortages essential infrastructure and health systems have collapsed a growing number of children are suffering from malnutrition and previously eradicated illnesses have re-emerged we have one of the highest homicide rates in the world which is aggravated by the government’s brutal crackdown on protesters this tragedy has prompted the largest exodus in latin american history with three million venezuelans now living abroad i would like to be clear about the situation in venezuela mr maduro’s re-election on may 20 2018 was illegitimate as has since been acknowledged by a large part of the international community his original six-year term was set to end on jan 10 by continuing to stay in office nicolás maduro is usurping the presidency my ascension as interim president is based on article 233 of the venezuelan constitution according to which if at the outset of a new term there is no elected head of state power is vested in the president of the national assembly until free and transparent elections take place this is why the oath i took on jan 23 cannot be considered a self-proclamation it was not of my own accord that i assumed the function of president that day but in adherence to the constitution i was 15 when hugo chávez came to power in 1998 at the time i lived in vargas state which borders the caribbean in 1999 torrential rains caused flash floods that left thousands of people dead i lost several friends and my school was buried in the mudslide the importance of resilience has been etched into my soul ever since both of my grandfathers served in the armed forces and they instilled a strong work ethic in their children that helped my family recover from those devastating floods i saw that if i wanted a better future for my country i had to roll up my sleeves and give my life to public service when it became clear that under chávez the country was drifting toward totalitarianism i joined the student movement which played a crucial role in delivering him a decisive loss on a referendum in 2007 that would have granted him sweeping powers i became involved in local politics and was elected to serve as a deputy representing vargas state in the national assembly in 2015 that same generation of brothers and sisters from my student movement days stands alongside me today as venezuelans from across the political spectrum are joining in an effort to re-establish democracy it is incumbent on us to reinstate normality in order to build the advanced and prosperous country of which we all dream but first we must recover our freedom the struggle for freedom has been part of our dna ever since independence was achieved in latin america 200 years ago in this century we have taken to the streets repeatedly knowing that not only is the survival of our democracy at stake but the very fate of our nation a pattern has developed under the maduro regime when pressure builds the first recourse is to repress and persecute i know this because buckshot pellets fired by members of the armed forces at peaceful protesters in 2017 remain lodged in my own body a minor price to pay compared to the sacrifices made by some of my compatriots under mr maduro at least 240 venezuelans have been murdered at marches and there are 600 political prisoners including the founder of my party leopoldo lópez who has been a prisoner for five years when repressive tactics prove futile mr maduro and his henchmen disingenuously propose dialogue but we have become immune to such manipulation there are no more stunts left for them to pull the usurpation of power was their only remaining option given that the maduro regime cannot legitimately retain power our response is threefold first to shore up the national assembly as the last bastion of democracy second to consolidate the support of the international community especially the lima group the organization of american states the united states and the european union and third to address the people on the basis that they have a right to self-determination over 50 countries have recognized either me as interim president or the national assembly as the legitimate authority in venezuela i have appealed to antónio guterres the united nations secretary general as well as to several humanitarian agencies for support in easing the humanitarian crisis i have begun the process of appointing ambassadors and locating and recovering national assets tied up abroad there is a broad consensus among venezuelans in favor of change 84 percent of our people reject mr maduro’s rule we have therefore been holding town halls across the country so people can talk openly about the moment in which we find ourselves and about our future among opposition politicians we have come up with three strategic points of agreement as part of our road map to democracy an end to the usurpation a transitional government and free elections the transition will require support from key military contingents we have had clandestine meetings with members of the armed forces and the security forces we have offered amnesty to all those who are found not guilty of crimes against humanity the military’s withdrawal of support from mr maduro is crucial to enabling a change in government and the majority of those in service agree that the country’s recent travails are untenable mr maduro no longer has the support of the people last week in caracas citizens from the poorest neighborhoods that had been chavista strongholds in the past took to the streets in unprecedented protests they went out again on jan 23 with the full knowledge that they might be brutally repressed and they continue to attend town hall meetings mr maduro’s time is running out but in order to manage his exit with the minimum of bloodshed all of venezuela must unite in pushing for a definitive end to his regime for that we need the support of pro-democratic governments institutions and individuals the world over it is imperative that we find effective solutions for the grave humanitarian crisis we are suffering just as it is to go on building a path toward understanding and reconciliation our strength and the salvation of all venezuela is in unity juan guaid is the president of the venezuelan national assembly and an opposition leader this essay was translated from the spanish by thomas bunstead follow the new york times opinion section on facebook twitter nytopinion and instagram

2021-02-14T18:38:31.046Z - articleBody received: the cover of gossamer’s debut issue features a mouthwatering image of orange juice being poured into a glass dotted with beads of condensation inside there’s an article about books as home décor status items a q and a with the writer and director janicza bravo and a fashion spread featuring the clothing lines of rosetta getty and gabriela hearst the magazine’s tag line and de facto motto high quality is opaque enough to not raise any red flags to narcs but also serves as a winking reference to its connective thread and defining subject matter marijuana in broccoli’s fourth and most recent issue between advertisements for the cannabis body care brand apothecanna and the weed delivery service eaze there’s a profile of the women who founded an ungendered skatewear brand and an advice column from emily post concerning how to tactfully talk about weed and at miss grass you’ll find a recipe for cucumber tomato and cbd salad a three-step how-to on rolling the perfect joint and a guide to los angeles’s best cannabis-friendly attractions miss grass’s slogan welcome to the high road we wanted to create something that reflected how we engage with cannabis on a daily or weekly or monthly basis in our personal lives said verena von pfetten who along with david weiner started gossamer magazine last year everyone uses it for a different reason to relax to sleep to have fun to go out to dinner or on a hike it’s about the experience you do after it was important for us to create a lifestyle publication that sat between cannabis and all the other interests of the consumer anja charbonneau the founder and creative director of broccoli and formerly of the hipster lifestyle bible kinfolk felt similarly there’s this huge swath of people who use marijuana in a considered way it’s not their life’s focus she said because it can touch so many different parts of life like food creativity politics and science it’s important to situate it in that bigger picture of lifestyle set against a backdrop in which marijuana legalization slowly works its way across the united states cannabis culture is being reframed thanks in part to independently run magazines with modest press runs but impressive coffee-table presence they are helping the archetype of marijuana smokers as shaggy-haired bloodshot-eyed burnouts evolve into one of cultured luxury-designer-wearing members of the creative class for a certain upper-middle-class demographic overwhelmingly white pot has all but been transformed from illicit drug to wellness item or indulgence akin to a fine wine or cigar a new generation of users are more likely to read goop than high times the stoner bible and publishers see an exciting opportunity in a marketplace that could reach 23.4 billion in consumer spending and employ a half-million americans by 2023 according to the cannabis data firm bds analytics print media is going up in smoke could weed of all things be its savior we’ve both worked at larger companies said mr weiner of gossamer referring to himself and ms von pfetten but working on something that we could build from the ground up in a growth industry and that speaks to our peers and which people want to spend time with to me what else would i be looking for in life at least at this point he is 33 ms von pfetten 35 said the cannabis space is obviously popular and buzzy but it’s nowhere near at capacity we’re still very much at the nascent stages for kate miller the c.e.o and a founder of miss grass it’s about building the brand miss grass launched last year hopefully we’ll have our own product line do more events partner with more cannabis and nonendemic brands ms miller said the big question is how to destigmatize and normalize this industry while the market is still small other titles are seeking to capitalize on its future growth there’s dope girls a scrappy zine out of atlanta and kitchen toke a foodie pot magazine out of chicago online there’s estrohaze which focuses on minority women in the marijuana industry living in portland and seeing all this creativity that went along with legal weed was really exciting said ms charbonneau who is in oregon while there was a lot of evolution going on the media side felt pretty stagnant very industry focused male dominated there was nothing for people like me who are casual but dedicated about their cannabis use people have responded to it overwhelmingly she said a lot of work has been done in just this year in terms of normalization so now it’s like how do we continue that narrative this is a sign that the stigma around cannabis is starting to disappear said morgan fox a spokesman for the national cannabis industry association as that stigma has started to erode we’re starting to see that cannabis consumers come from a wide variety of walks of life mr fox who started working in the field a decade ago remembers seeing issues of high times on magazine stands wrapped in plastic and placed near pornographic titles today cannabis magazines are sold at trendy bookstores likes mcnally jackson and the strand in new york or offered in-room at hip boutique hotels like the ace in los angeles and palm springs ms miller started her cannabis career while working at a medical marijuana shop in downtown los angeles during college at the time everything we were selling leaned in to that stoner bro stigma she said it had giant weed leaves on it and rastafarian signs when it came to her personal use ms miller saw a stark divide between reality and media representation the way that my girlfriends and i were speaking about consuming and integrating pot into our lives felt so different than how it was portrayed not only in pop culture but within cannabis culture she said she had the foresight to buy the web address for miss grass at that time in 2008 not yet knowing how she would put it to use there was a demographic that everyone was speaking to that was old and tired it was these stereotypes and clichés mr weiner said we felt like a lot of brands and media companies weren’t taking into account the realities of sophisticated consumers and readers and how they act and what they think about or what they desire in the world still there are challenges marijuana is recreationally legal in only nine states and medically legal in 31 because of this legal limbo there are byzantine rules and regulations regarding how weed can be marketed including a ban on online advertising many cannabis companies however are making a lot of money and want to use some for promotion and perceive that an aspirational lifestyle magazine is the ideal product in which to promote their products are they high a lot of brands really want to be a part of this evolution of the culture ms charbonneau said they want to support others who are doing interesting work and lifting up interesting people in the community with their playful aesthetics and generally lighthearted stories these publications may appear blissfully oblivious to certain political realities of the drug but staffers were careful to indicate to check their privilege to use the lingo of the day we always say if you’re not thinking of the social justice aspect of this and you work in cannabis you’re doing it very very wrong mr weiner said we wanted to be upfront and thoughtful about the social justice component about cannabis as well when you think of how many people are allowed to participate and how many people are still in jail for minor cannabis-related offenses ms charbonneau said she plans on donating a portion of profits from sales of broccoli’s fourth issue to the brooklyn community bail fund which helps people who are jailed for minor offenses and are unable to pay for bail a lot of what we do is about educating consumers on how to use the product but also educating them on how we got here ms miller said much of the content of these magazines may be trendy and apolitical but ms miller noted as well the importance of acknowledging the harsher history of pot namely the victims of the war on drugs she said most of whom have been minorities the new magazines their editors say also reflect the groups forged by pot smokers in real life david talked about going to weddings as the plus-one and you go outside and see people smoking weed and you’ve got a community for the night ms von pfetten said when we thought about content it’s like how do we put people forward she mentioned conversations a feature of monologues with attractive product shots these are the types of people you meet and you don’t talk about weed the whole time she said it comes up peripherally and it’s something you connect on and share your favorite products or experiences but the person is so much more than that ms von pfetten added that she wants gossamer to be a global brand that people who are into cannabis can relate to what that looks like who knows she said the industry is literally changing on a month-to-month basis

situation but at least i was a candidate for surgery recovering in mount sinai hospital in new york city having just been filleted solar plexus to navel i exhaled into the plastic spirometer that measured my airflow it felt like a miniature version of that strong man carnival game in which you pound a mallet to try to ring a bell meanwhile there was the quotidian task of managing my children’s calendars from my iphone while texts emails and facebook messages flooded in well-wishers checking up on how i was recovering when i messaged my ex-husband to ask if he could take our daughter to a birthday party his reply popped back and there it was his name which is my name too just as in elementary school choir john jacob jingleheimer schmidt except our name was chang i thought about the liver surgery team fellow who did a double take in the pre-op room he was looking for pari chang he looked at the sign on the door that said chang and looked at me the non-asian patient and began walking away hold up i’d called out you have the right room my ex-husband is chinese i was wondering he confessed laughing in a paper gown with no makeup or jewelry and wearing my glasses no contact lenses for patients headed to the o.r my last name felt like an accessory post surgery exchanging texts with my ex over kid-logistics i considered the decision i had made 17 years earlier to take his chinese surname at the time this traditional wifely move felt radical to me because it signaled that i was part of a mixed-race couple back then at 27 i was experiencing some self-consciousness about my own origins my father was a successful small business owner a meatpacker and though my parents were street smart and financially secure to me their know-it-all bookish daughter they seemed unrefined i was eager to marry into my husband’s clan a family of scientists and calligraphers of professors and gourmet cooks chang symbolized the reinvention of myself from jersey girl to pan-cultural sophisticate a line from the lorrie moore novel a gate at the stairs resonated for me i’d always been opposed to a woman taking her husband’s name but when i changed mine i suddenly knew the relief in such an act through the divorce i held on to my married name like a tether to the family i’d made chang was on my driver’s license my passport and my children’s birth certificates you come to own your name just as you own your own body it is the skin of you your packaging your label and your presentation i was channeling erica jong another jewish writer who’d divorced a chinese man and kept his surname plus it felt right to have the same last name as my kids no one believes you’re my mom my almond-eyed son said once at camp pickup wounded confusion in his voice but the name was the proof yet recovering in the hospital battling the big c and preposterously negotiating the chaperoning of a roller-skating party i was fiercely determined to survive which took reconnecting to my essential self frankly the whole fact of this cancer a malignancy in my colon that later metastasized to my liver felt inconceivable i was young and fit only in my 40s but apparently part of the medical conundrum du jour the sharp uptick of colorectal cancer diagnoses in americans under 50 my grandma sooky would have had a psychological explanation for the target organ of my illness you’re eating your kishkes out over this divorce she’d have said kishkes being yiddish for intestines or guts perhaps that old-world thinking contained a kernel of wisdom jack my partner of six and a half years had long observed that i hadn’t wholly let go of my ex he was right evidenced by the fact that i had kept his name in the midst of my cancer recurrence jack and i married we felt an urgency to make our love official as a bonus he had excellent health insurance on our wedding day we sandwiched our visit to city hall between a pet scan and a consult with a liver surgeon i was literally radioactive when we said our i do’s but i would have been glowing anyway the irony is i never once considered taking jack’s last name i don’t think it crossed his mind either the young woman i once was seeking otherness and urbanity a striver with class insecurities had evolved into a stalwart mother in new jersey raising her kids in her hometown with their grandma the mettle it took for my parents to muscle into the middle class turned out to be my lucky inheritance the woman jack married is her parents daughter pari berk home from the hospital i made the name change facebook-official and the likes poured in yet when i broke the news to my 9-year-old daughter she cried and my 12-year-old son in typical preteen fashion sulked and gave me the silent treatment no doubt news of yet another change was disconcerting to them during a month of uncertainty i circled back to the kids separately a few hours later though and they seemed to soften both uttering some version of it’s up to you mom lately my son has been especially snuggly my little girl has taken to leaving me inspirational messages on her chalkboard you’ll be ok my favorite one begins you will fight through this with all you can and with hope and determability you can do anything cancer can be a killer but it can also be a clarifier changing my name back to pari berk feels like a kind of self-affirmation it roots me i lost a chunk of myself in december but i reclaimed a piece too pari berk is a lawyer and writer who is completing a memoir

2021-02-14T19:47:05.019Z - articleBody received: in a refurbished salvation army building in downtown lincoln neb bob hinrichs runs a co-working space for about 150 people the workers are not allowed to bring in their dogs and they don’t curl up in beanbag chairs but they are encouraged to collaborate with one another and with the city’s wider business community mr hinrichs works to nurture connections among the small businesses software developers public-relations consultants and sustainable-agriculture advocates that work in his space and he says such cooperation is helping the local economy like other operators of so-called boutique co-working spaces in smaller cities mr hinrichs is also seeking to distinguish his business fuse coworking from the big players like wework and regus the fast-expanding co-working movement is transforming the workplace and attracting investors the japanese telecom conglomerate softbank recently increased its stake in wework to about 10.5 billion valuing it at 47 billion some larger competitors strive to create a freewheeling atmosphere by allowing pets and skateboards in their work spaces and offering ping-pong tables and juice bars but mr hinrichs said his members felt a sense of belonging in a distinctively local building and benefited from regular contact with business leaders in the community you have access in lincoln to people and getting things done and a sort of can-do barn-raising mentality he said mr hinrichs returned to his native lincoln seven years ago after living in the bay area where he became interested in the co-working concept the co-working space came out of that he said since opening fuse coworking has expanded to about 40,000 square feet from 2,500 square feet its services range from drop-in desks for the occasional worker for 50 a month to dedicated desks plus 20 hours of meeting-room space for 300 a month the space the first of its kind in lincoln is used by about 55 companies that employ anywhere from one to 35 people it has been embraced by the city’s business community which sees it as an important incubator and contributor to the local economy mr hinrichs said in pittsburgh the detective building which once housed the police department’s homicide division is the latest location for beauty shoppe a commercial real estate developer that creates co-working spaces intended to have local appeal it’s the seventh space opened in pittsburgh by beauty shoppe which seeks buildings in neighborhoods that it views as underserved by co-working space the company also has a space in cleveland and it just started construction on one in detroit it has plans for more in portland me providence r.i and columbus ohio they are in places that are underdiscovered but have a bit of soul and character and we see an undersupply of quality co-working said matthew ciccone one of the company’s founders with its modular sofas coffee tables and high ceilings the new space is meant to be a comfortable and productive place for businesses that include not only the tech start-ups that might be expected but also people like accountants lawyers graphic designers and architects mr ciccone said small businesses were better served in boutique co-working spaces than in national chains like wework and would benefit from more amenities than in conventional office spaces if you are a four-person graphic design company your options are usually substandard class b office space with an old-school stodgy landlord that just doesn’t provide a lot of services for you and your employees he said mr ciccone’s clients include courtney watts an employee of the i.t consultant infosys in chicago who moved back to her native pittsburgh a year ago after about a dozen years away she signed up with beauty shoppe with the aim of reconnecting with the city ms watts 30 commutes to chicago where she usually works three or four days a week the rest of her time she alternates among three beauty shoppe locations she connected with other workers there more easily than she had in bigger co-working spaces in boston and toronto which she called more cookie cutter of all the co-working spaces i’ve worked i haven’t felt it as strongly as i have with beauty shoppe she said people want to talk to each other people want to know what the other person is up to benjamin schmidt chief technology officer for roadbotics a two-year-old technology company said he and his fellow founders had chosen to rent space in the pittsburgh detective building because its individual design with exposed steel beams was more attractive than the office vibe at some other co-working spaces they had looked at he said any co-working space made more sense for his staff about 30 full and part-time employees than a conventional office building because of the lower costs and greater amenities if we were to sign a commercial lease it would be a three or five-year term mr schmidt said we don’t have any idea where we’re going to be three or five years from now i don’t know whether we will exist he added for a start-up or a small business co-working space is a no-brainer when it comes to value despite the efforts of boutique co-working spaces to differentiate themselves from bigger competitors it’s not clear whether they will be able to maintain their edge while growing said kevin michals managing partner at cross properties a building owner and developer in philadelphia he predicted that co-working spaces would become standardized as they consolidated as big corporate clients increasingly demanded a consistent product across multiple locations and as venture capitalists investing in co-working providers sought returns if i’m i.b.m i don’t want to sign a hundred different contracts in six different cities said mr michals whose company is refurbishing a 50,000-square-foot building for regus in downtown philadelphia but some boutique owners remain convinced that small is beautiful and they have no plans to homogenize their spaces nick petroski one of the founders of osc tech lab a 45-member co-working space in an old railroad building in akron ohio said smaller locations had the best chance of competing with the big players by creating a personalized atmosphere we decided to take a different route where we actually give a damn about the people that are here and we ended up making friends with a lot of them said mr petroski who has doubled his space to 5,000 square feet over five years on busy days you are getting a lot of people and it’s harder to find a spot

musical voice the announcements were simply the latest examples of women being sorely unheard in film music a 2018 study by the university of southern california revealed that for the top 100 fictional films at the box office every year from 2007 to 2017 only 16 female composers were hired compared with more than 1,200 men another report from the center for the study of women in television and film showed that of the top 250 films at the domestic box office in 2018 94 percent were scored by men the numbers are bleak but the landscape isn’t said laura karpman a veteran film composer paris can wait and a governor in the music branch of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences people are reaching out in a way that i’ve never seen it my whole career karpman was instrumental in expanding the diversity of her branch’s membership which now includes the russian composer sofia gubaidulina karpman also spearheaded the creation of a shortlist in the score category of the

the 2003 horror film willard yet she could never break into the top-tier movies she was helping men with i don’t think she got in the door for the same meetings that the guys would get said lolita ritmanis a composer who was mentored by walker i wouldn’t say she was bitter she was a fighter till the end the first woman to win an oscar for best score was rachel portman for emma in 1996 the only other woman to win that prize is anne dudley for the full monty the next year the film industry portman said tends to be quite cautious she added that directors feel more comfortable with composers who have done something really similar-sounding before which immediately makes it very difficult to break in and also this feeling that there’s safety if someone else has hired someone before which i think is particularly hard for women she said she had worked with only two openly misogynistic directors and noted the occasional delicious challenge of a filmmaker presuming she’s not capable of writing tough music that is for action scenes or anything in a mode not stereotypically feminine i’m like are you kidding and i’ll just prove to them that i can the women interviewed for this article offered a variety of reasons for the longstanding inequality institutionalized sexism a lack of precedents and female role models to inspire girls to go into the field and the social conditioning of women to be selfless caretakers and not seize the spotlight increasingly women are entering the profession but are still outnumbered by men the film scoring certificate program at the university of california los angeles has produced 120 graduates since 2013 of which only 25 percent were female likewise only a quarter of applicants to the film scoring graduate program at u.s.c this year were female although the school invited seven women to join its 20-student program portman suggested that universities pumping so many aspiring composers into such a small competitive field might itself be a problem several workshops including the sundance institute film music program which has achieved gender parity the past two years and the ascap film scoring workshop are trying to provide more women with real-world experience and access to the industry universal pictures started its film music composer initiative to find talented women and people of color winning candidates are writing orchestral scores and running recording sessions at abbey road for shorts created by dreamworks animation nora kroll-rosenbaum scored the program’s first short bird karma she praised the initiative for providing opportunities adding that door has been very much shut for a lot of people there are also new resources for support the alliance for women film composers was founded in 2014 and now has close to 400 members it has raised the visibility of women through concerts and advocacy work and provides solidarity in a lonely profession with no formal union it’s a sisterhood it’s a resource said ritmanis president of the alliance and although we are very much competitors we are also each others cheerleaders i think because of the global awareness of women’s rights and metoo and time’s up and all these different movements she added there is an interest and a call to action among studios and decision makers people call me wanting to meet and figure out what they can do and i do think that there’s a lot more opportunity for women to be part of the big audition process for major feature assignments as there should be given their talent said doreen ringer-ross an executive in the film music division of broadcast music inc the performing rights organization which manages the catalogs of many of hollywood’s top composers the job of a composer is to be really sensitive is to interpret the emotion of things musically she said and women are traditionally great at doing that still emerging composers face a double standard jesi nelson has been apprenticing with several male composers as she develops her own career and she’s dealt with potential bosses commenting about her legs or musicians assuming that she’s somebody’s personal assistant when she’s actually running a recording session i do get angry and sometimes i’m just like what’s the point nelson said if i’m working these ridiculous hours seven days a week 18-hour days and it’s paying off for somebody to diminish everything that i’ve worked hard for in a few words based on my gender like why am i even doing this but i love it way too much so i won’t stop

conversion therapy for minors deep-blue new york was not among them that finally changed this month when the state legislature voted overwhelmingly to bar mental health professionals from working to change a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity as jurisdictions across the country began solidifying protections for the gay lesbian bisexual and transgender communities conversion therapy became part of the public discourse in 2016 l.g.b.t groups denounced the republican party for adopting a platform that seemed to lend support to the technique which had long been discredited by the medical establishment vice president mike pence has been particularly dogged by criticism the groups say mr pence had previously been in favor of conversion therapy a stance that he has denied new york lawmakers had been proposing bills addressing conversion therapy since 2003 the measures languished until this month when democrats took control of the legislature for the first time in a decade the legislature this month also passed the gender expression non-discrimination act or genda which would add gender identity as a protected class under new york’s discrimination and hate crimes laws the bills were the first pieces of l.g.b.t.-specific legislation to pass the senate since lawmakers voted to legalize same-sex marriage in 2011 state senator brad hoylman a manhattan democrat said it was a quantum leap forward said mr hoylman who is the only out gay lawmaker in the senate and who sponsored both bills i hope we can build on that gov andrew m cuomo has said he would sign both bills so-called l.g.b.t.q conversion therapy is a fraudulent practice that has done untold harm to too many young people mr cuomo said in a statement conversion therapy also called reparative therapy has been widely denounced by medical professional organizations as traumatizing and harmful to minors the american academy of pediatrics warned against it as early as 1993 saying it reinforced anxiety and shame in 2009 the american psychological association condemned the practice in a report saying that conversion therapy was predicated on the idea that homosexuality was a mental disorder but despite the consensus that conversion therapy was unsound it has remained fairly common said mathew shurka who underwent conversion therapy and works as an activist fighting against it an estimated 698,000 l.g.b.t adults in the united states have received conversion therapy according to research by the williams institute at the u.c.l.a school of law which studies l.g.b.t issues about half of them underwent conversion therapy as teenagers mr shurka was among them he was 16 years old in 2004 when his father took him to a therapist who said he could make gay people straight and he spent five years undergoing the purported treatment conversion therapy assumes that everyone is a heterosexual mr shurka said and that same-sex attraction is caused by childhood trauma the therapists say if you can just heal that trauma and understand what your role is as a male or female you will naturally start to be attracted to the opposite sex he said mr shurka said he was told to separate from his mother and sister for three years to make sure that he did not look at women as his peers mr shurka worked with mr hoylman and assemblywoman deborah j glick a manhattan democrat who was new york’s first out gay legislator when they introduced a bill to ban conversion therapy in the state in 2013 at that time only california had passed a similar law a year earlier months after the new york bill was introduced new jersey passed its own legislation barring conversion therapy yet new york stood still the bill cleared the democrat-led assembly but was blocked in the republican-controlled senate where it never received a floor vote for years mr hoylman kept reintroducing the bill each time his efforts met the same result while laws were passed in traditional liberal bastions like connecticut and washington d.c and also approved through a bipartisan effort in new hampshire there a republican legislator sponsored the bill and a republican governor signed it into law new york most certainly lagged behind mr hoylman said over the years mr shurka and other advocates worked to educate state lawmakers about conversion therapy many of the people he spoke with did not believe conversion therapy was a modern problem mr shurka said he blamed that lack of awareness on the stigma associated with the practice if your parents are putting you into it they’re not telling their neighbors or friends mr shurka said it’s not really talked about and even for the person that’s in it mr cuomo addressed the issue in 2016 when he prevented conversion therapy from being covered by insurers a number of cities and counties in the state also passed bans including new york city in 2017 this year mr hoylman’s bill was passed as part of a slate of policies that democrats are seeking to enact now that they have full control of the legislature after winning a majority in the senate in november the conversion therapy ban received strong bipartisan support passing the assembly 134 to 3 and the senate 57 to 4 mr shurka who was in albany for the senate vote said he was shocked by the result which he said was pivotal for me conversion therapy is the source of all l.g.b.t rights he said it’s still that question of can someone change

2021-02-14T19:59:14.717Z - articleBody received: washington a pair of influential federal reserve officials said wednesday that the central bank should pause to assess economic conditions before considering additional interest rate increases reinforcing the message delivered last week by the fed chairman jerome h powell the fed on wednesday also published an account of its most recent meeting in december which showed that most fed officials had already reached a similar conclusion at that time taken together the speeches and the meeting minutes signal that the fed will not raise its benchmark interest rate at its january meeting and that it is unlikely to do so at the following meeting in mid-march but most fed officials still expect that economic growth will be strong enough to justify rate increases later in the year eric rosengren the president of the federal reserve bank of boston told a boston audience that the fed was puzzling through the recent divergence between strong economic data and faltering financial markets at this juncture with two very different scenarios economic slowdown implied by financial markets or growth somewhat above potential g.d.p growth consistent with economic forecasts i believe we can wait for greater clarity before adjusting policy he said charles evans the president of the federal reserve bank of chicago delivered a similar message in a speech wednesday in riverwoods ill i feel we have good capacity to wait and carefully take stock of the incoming data and other developments he said the remarks were significant because both men spoke in favor of the fed’s rate increases last year and both hold rotating votes on the fed’s policy committee james bullard the president of the federal reserve bank of st louis who opposed the rate increases last year told the wall street journal on tuesday that he too favored a pause the fed is bordering on going too far and possibly tipping the economy into recession mr bullard said he added that other fed officials were coming around to his position that the fed should pause the fed at its december meeting raised its benchmark rate into a range between 2.25 and 2.5 percent it was the fifth consecutive quarterly increase mr powell said the rate now stood near the lower end of the range that the fed regards as neutral territory neither encouraging nor discouraging borrowing and economic growth at a news conference after the december meeting mr powell emphasized that economic growth remained strong and that the fed expected to continue raising rates in 2019 investors registered their disapproval by driving down asset prices exacerbating a market slump since then mr powell and other fed officials have sought to deliver a more nuanced message emphasizing that they are paying attention to investors concerns and that the absence of inflationary pressure means the fed can afford to postpone judgment the account of the december meeting reinforced that message the fed according to the minutes said that participants expressed that recent developments including the volatility in financial markets and the increased concerns about global growth made the appropriate extent and timing of future policy firming less clear than earlier the fed’s own economic outlook remains upbeat the minutes described economic data in the final months of 2018 as even stronger than the fed had expected mr rosengren said consumers remained willing to spend and he expected unemployment would continue to fall mr evans said he was still forecasting another good year in 2019 but uncertainties have piled up in recent months the minutes said investors were particularly concerned about trade tensions between the united states and china and about global growth the minutes did not mention that investors also fear that the fed will make a mistake by raising interest rates too quickly snuffing out the economic expansion the recent downturn in financial markets is both a symptom of these worries and a potential problem in its own right declines in invested wealth or reductions in lending can infect the broader economy the message from fed officials is that the fed will wait to see who is correct if the pessimism evident in financial markets eventually shows through to economic outcomes there would be less need and perhaps no need for further increases in interest rates mr rosengren said however my current expectation is that the more optimistic view will prevail to reinforce that policy decisions will depend on the latest economic data the minutes said that the officials discussed changes in the fed’s communications since the 2008 crisis the fed has leaned heavily on forward guidance to manage market expectations about its plans in recent months it has sought to reduce that guidance encouraging investors to focus instead on the latest economic data at the december meeting fed officials also continued to discuss the fed’s gradual reduction of its holdings of treasuries and mortgage bonds which were acquired during and after the financial crisis as part of the central bank’s campaign to stimulate economic growth the fed which is reducing the holdings at a regular pace has said that it does not want to adjust that pace in response to changes in economic conditions preferring to adjust interest rates instead but the minutes said that fed officials discussed the possibility of adjusting the pace for technical reasons as part of the process of determining how large a portfolio the fed should maintain in the longer term

2021-02-14T19:59:14.878Z - articleBody received: do you remember the winter of debt in late 2010 and early 2011 the u.s economy had barely begun to recover from the 2008 financial crisis around 9 percent of the labor force was still unemployed long-term unemployment was especially severe with more than 6 million americans having been out of work for 6 months or more you might have expected the continuing employment crisis to be the focus of most economic policy discussion but no washington was obsessed with debt the simpson-bowles report was the talk of the town paul ryan’s impassioned and of course hypocritical denunciations of federal debt won him media adulation and awards and between the capital’s debt obsession the republican takeover of the house and a hard right turn in state governments america was about to embark on a period of cutbacks in government spending unprecedented in the face of high unemployment some of us protested bitterly against this policy turn arguing that a period of mass unemployment was no time for fiscal austerity and we were mostly right why only mostly because it’s becoming increasingly doubtful whether there’s any right time for fiscal austerity the obsession with debt is looking foolish even at full employment that’s the message i take from olivier blanchard’s presidential address to the american economic association to be fair blanchard one of the world’s leading macroeconomists formerly the extremely influential chief economist of the i.m.f was cautious in his pronouncements and certainly didn’t go all mmt and say that debt never matters but his analysis nonetheless makes the fix the debt fixation yes they’re still out there look even worse than before blanchard starts with the commonplace observation that interest rates on government debt are quite low which in itself means that worries about debt are overblown but he makes a more specific point the average interest rate on debt is less than the economy’s growth rate r<g moreover this isn’t a temporary aberration interest rates less than growth are actually the norm broken only for a relatively short stretch in the 1980s why does this matter there are actually two separate but related implications of low interest rates first fears of a runaway spiral of rising debt are based on a myth second raising private investment shouldn’t be a huge priority on the first point diatribes about debt often come with ominous warnings that debt may snowball over time that is high debt will mean high interest payments which drive up deficits leading to even more debt which leads to even higher interest rates and so on but what matters for government solvency isn’t the absolute level of debt but its level relative to the tax base which in turn basically corresponds to the size of the economy and the dollar value of g.d.p normally grows over time due to both growth and inflation other things equal this gradually melts the snowball even if debt is rising in dollar terms it will shrink as a percentage of g.d.p if deficits aren’t too large the classic example is what happened to u.s debt from world war ii when and how did we pay it off the answer is that we never did yet as figure 1 shows despite rising dollar debt by 1970 growth and inflation had reduced the debt to an easily handled share of g.d.p and if interest rates are less than g.d.p growth this effect means that debt tends to melt away of its own accord a high debt level means higher interest payments but it also means more melting and the latter effect predominates a self-reinforcing debt spiral just doesn’t happen blanchard’s second point is subtler but still important in general debt scolds warn not just about threats to government solvency but about growth the claim is that high public debt feeds current consumption at the expense of investment for the future and high debt does indeed probably have that effect when the economy is near full employment although in 2010-2011 more deficit spending would have led to more not less private investment but how important is it to suppress consumption to free up resources for investment what blanchard points out is that low interest rates are an indication that the private sector sees fairly low returns on investment so that diverting more resources to private investment won’t make that much difference to growth true the rate of return on investment is surely higher than the interest rate on safe assets like u.s treasuries but blanchard makes the case that it’s not as much higher as many seem to think does this mean that we should eat drink be merry and forget about the future no but private investment isn’t the big issue since it probably doesn’t have a very high rate of return blanchard doesn’t say this but what we should probably be worrying about instead is public investment in infrastructure which has been neglected and suffers from obvious deficiencies yet the debt obsession led to less not more public investment figure 2 shows public construction spending as a percentage of g.d.p it rose briefly during the obama stimulus partly because g.d.p was down then plunged to historically low levels where it has stayed for all the talk about taking care of future generations debt scolds have almost surely hurt not helped our future prospects notice by the way that i haven’t even talked about business-cycle-related reasons to stop obsessing over debt an environment of persistently low interest rates raises concerns about secular stagnation a tendency to suffer repeated intractable slumps because the fed doesn’t have enough ammunition to fight them and such slumps may reduce long-term growth as well the experience since 2008 suggests a high degree of hysteresis in which seemingly short-run downturns end up reducing long-run economic potential but even without these concerns debt looks like a hugely overblown issue and the way debt displaced unemployment at the heart of public debate in 2010-2011 just keeps looking worse follow the new york times opinion section on facebook twitter nytopinion and instagram

deductions that i’d missed i’m financially disorganized at the best of times and with a baby and a toddler i was barely even trying to keep track of my business expenses so it’s not surprising that i hadn’t noticed the hundreds of dollars of weird recurring bank charges that my husband discovered it turned out i’d been signed up for a dubious program that purported to protect users credit in certain emergency situations my bank had been accused of fraudulent practices in connection with it and fined 700 million by the consumer financial protection bureau the government agency that was senator elizabeth warren’s brainchild i tried maddeningly to seek redress from the bank cycling through phone trees screaming at automated operators no one could tell me how i’d been enrolled in the program or for how long eventually i turned to the c.f.p.b itself filling out a simple form on its website a few weeks later i was notified that the bank had been deducting money from my account for years and i was being refunded more than 11,000 having financed my own maternity leave i badly needed the money listen to the argument podcast every thursday morning with ross douthat michelle goldberg and david leonhardt republicans who under president trump have been gutting the c.f.p.b have long decried the agency as an overweening bureaucracy to me it was an astonishingly user-friendly tool that cut through opaque corporate bureaucracy on my behalf my experience with it shaped my perception of warren as a brilliant policy innovator since then my husband who works at a digital strategy firm has done work for warren he’s fully behind her presidential candidacy i’m enthusiastic about it as well but i also find myself excited by washington gov jay inslee’s announcement that he’s considering a presidential run centered on the battle against climate change perhaps this is naïve but his entry could encourage a substantive argument about progressive priorities one that transcends facile theater criticism ideological purity tests or horse-race handicapping inslee is far from a household name but like warren he has a record of policy successes he’s a former congressman who led the democratic governors association last year when democrats won seven new governorships under his leadership washington state has thrived as he pointed out to me this week it has the fastest job growth in the country it has raised the minimum wage invested in education and transportation and passed one of the country’s most generous paid family leave bills and most comprehensive voting rights legislation the state said inslee is exhibit a demonstrating why progressive economic policies grow your economy if he runs for president it will be with a single-minded focus on averting climate calamity in part through an enormous investment in green jobs and infrastructure we have to have a mobilization of our nation’s energies and intellectual capability and entrepreneurial zeal equivalent to our other great challenges that we have met including world war ii and the apollo project he said he added a line he’s repeated elsewhere this is the first generation who has felt the damage from climate change and we are the last generation to be able to do something about it warren of course will also be good on climate and she has endorsed the idea of a green new deal put forward by democrats like representative alexandria ocasio-cortez but her central focus is on economic inequality corruption and mammoth corporate power inslee dreams of uniting the country including at least some of corporate america against an existential external threat this is a moment where we can all be heroes and all of us have a role to play in this heroic effort he said warren is ready to lead a fight a word she uses often against the bloated monopolistic ruling class inside our society america’s middle class is under attack she said in the video announcing the launch of her presidential exploratory committee how did we get here billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie both of these visions are sweeping and progressive but they seek to channel different energies toward different if overlapping goals one is full of technocratic optimism the other is populist and pugilistic you can’t compare them using the frameworks insider vs outsider head vs heart that usually dominate campaign reporting evaluating them will require democrats to think hard about their highest aspirations to decide what is most important to them and most menacing of course there will be other candidates other platforms other conceptions of what the country is and could be as the race goes on strategic and process questions will come into play pundits will ponder whether candidates particularly women candidates are sufficiently likable and ask how they might appeal to swing voters while turning out the base that part already feels exhausting and it hasn’t even begun but the primary season could also maybe be a chance to hash out big forward-looking ideas later on democrats will have to debate the path to 270 electoral college votes for now there’s space to debate the path to a livable american future follow the new york times opinion section on facebook twitter nytopinion and instagram

2021-02-14T19:59:15.057Z - articleBody received: beijing three days of trade negotiations between midlevel american and chinese officials ended in beijing on wednesday afternoon with progress in identifying and narrowing the two sides differences but little sense of when they might reach a deal the trade talks could help clear the way for higher-level talks this month when president trump attends the world economic forum in davos switzerland vice premier liu he china’s economic czar is expected to go to washington sometime after that in a statement after the talks ended the united states trade representative’s office said the two sides had discussed china’s pledge to buy a substantial amount of american agricultural energy and manufacturing products negotiators also focused on white house concerns about china’s approach to intellectual property protection and its practice of so-called forced technology transfer the statement said the trump administration wants to ensure that china keeps its commitments in any deal that is reached to that end the statement said officials discussed the need for any agreement to provide for complete implementation subject to ongoing verification and effective enforcement china’s commerce ministry said in a statement on thursday morning on its official mini-blogging account that the two sides had conducted extensive in-depth and meticulous exchanges on trade issues and structural issues of common concern which enhanced mutual understanding and laid the foundation for resolving mutual concerns both parties agreed to continue to maintain close contact the statement continued without specifying when or where the next meeting might be held the united states delegation plans to report back to the white house to determine what happens next the administration has set a march 2 deadline for raising tariffs on roughly two-fifths of annual american imports from china if no deal is reached i’m optimistic that they’re making progress the tone of the talks is important and this tone has been good said dean pinkert a former commissioner of the united states international trade commission who is now a trade law partner at hughes hubbard reed a big international law firm it is still important to the u.s government to get credible commitments at issue is the extent to which china is willing to offer binding commitments to change trade practices that have long irked president trump and his administration the scheduled two-day talks extended into a third day as american officials pressed china for more details on how it will live up to its commitments said people with knowledge of the negotiations who insisted on anonymity to avoid disrupting the talks china has made a series of offers to the trump administration in recent weeks to end the trade war but many of the administration’s trade hawks regard them as nebulous especially when it comes to chinese trade practices that administration officials consider unfair they allege that officials in china pressure foreign companies to transfer key technologies to chinese rivals as a condition for entering the country’s market they also protest lavish government subsidies granted through the made in china 2025 program to build local companies into global powerhouses in industries like commercial aircraft semiconductors and electric cars china denies that its trade practices have been unfair nevertheless officials have agreed to make it easier for multinational corporations to participate in manufacturing development programs in china they have also promised to improve intellectual property protection and to ban the forced transfer of technology both sides see reasons to reach a deal soon mr trump wants to stabilize volatile financial markets people familiar with the administration’s deliberations said president xi jinping of china is trying to confront weak business and consumer confidence which have already triggered a sharp economic slowdown in his country adding to the difficulty of reaching a deal has been the fractious nature of the trump administration with the three main government departments involved in the negotiations each pursuing a somewhat different agenda those different agendas to some extent reflect each agency’s institutional biases and responsibilities but make it harder to predict what a final deal will look like robert e lighthizer the united states trade representative and a hawk on trade issues has led the push to impose tariffs on imports from china and has pursued an ambitious agenda that would require china to carry out verifiable and enforceable changes to the basic structure of its economy mr trump said last month that mr lighthizer would be the lead trade negotiator with china the commerce department which oversees american export promotion activities overseas and commerce secretary wilbur ross have been pushing since the early days of the administration for a deal that would require china to buy more food natural gas and other products from the united states beijing officials have been happy to go along as their country is short on arable land and gas and long-term purchase agreements fit easily into the chinese government’s economic planning model the treasury department under secretary steven mnuchin has been pushing for a quick deal that would stop further increases in american tariffs but treasury would preserve indefinitely the 25 percent tariffs that mr trump imposed in july and august on 50 billion a year in chinese-made goods or roughly a tenth of american imports and the 10 percent tariffs that he imposed in september on an additional 200 billion in chinese goods that first set of tariffs covers several categories in which china does not export much now but plans to do so in the next several years the most important products covered by the 25 percent tariffs are gasoline-powered and electric cars at least six chinese automakers have announced plans to start exporting cars to the united states in 2020 said michael dunne the chief executive of zozo go an automotive consulting firm specializing in china import duties will slow but not stop chinese automakers plans to enter the u.s he said with a slowing home market pressure to export has never been greater democrats and republicans alike have been wary of allowing an influx of chinese cars in an election year particularly when manufacturing states like indiana michigan ohio and wisconsin have been among the main electoral battlegrounds in recent decades in the latest sign that the chinese economy could use a lift from a trade agreement officials announced wednesday evening that car sales plummeted 19 percent last month from a year earlier the steepest such decline in modern record-keeping in china mr trump and mr xi agreed in buenos aires on dec 1 to a temporary truce that would keep last summer’s american tariffs in place and suspend much of china’s retaliation for those tariffs but had few other details so the quickest possible deal in the coming weeks could be to make that arrangement more permanent complicating the trade talks has been mr xi’s decision to invite north korea’s leader kim jong-un to visit beijing this week mr trump has been pushing north korea to abandon the development of missiles with nuclear warheads that can reach the united states but he needs china’s cooperation to do so because china is north korea’s main ally and largest trading partner yonhap the south korean news agency reported that mr kim left beijing early wednesday afternoon about the same time that the trade talks ended lu kang the chinese foreign ministry spokesman declined to provide details

company she and her husband hans knoll ran for many years to connoisseurs of modernism the mid-20th-century designs of florence knoll as she was known were and still are the essence of the genre’s clean functional forms transcending design fads they are still influential still contemporary still common in offices homes and public spaces still found in dealers showrooms and represented in museum collections ms knoll learned her art at the side of modernist masters she was a protég of the german-american architect ludwig mies van der rohe and eliel saarinen the finnish architect and teacher and the father of the architect eero saarinen and she worked with the renowned bauhaus architects walter gropius and marcel breuer throughout her career influenced by the german bauhaus school of

interiors and furnishings in the 1950s and 60s transforming the cbs seagram and look magazine headquarters in manhattan the h j heinz headquarters in pittsburgh and properties across the united states europe asia and south america including american embassies her total design favored open work spaces over private offices and furniture grouped for informal discussions it integrated lighting vibrant colors acoustical fabrics chairs molded like tulip petals sofas and desks with chrome legs collegially oval meeting tables and futuristic multilevel interiors more architectural than decorative with open-riser staircases that seemed to float in the air besides doing strategic planning and designing furniture herself ms knoll recruited and hired many of the world’s best postwar designers she staked the sculptor harry bertoia to two years in a studio barn to see if working with metals he could turn out furniture his wire chairs became knoll classics she asked eero saarinen to design a chair like a great big basket of pillows that i can curl up in he created the body-embracing womb chair she also brought designer friends and former teachers into the fold by acquiring rights to their creations paying them commissions and royalties and giving them credit for their designs some of the 20th century’s most admired designs thus became knoll replicas including isamu noguchi’s cyclone table 1950 held up by a whorl of rods like a tornado funnel and the barcelona chair the sloped leather-and-steel piece created by mies van der rohe and lilly reich for the 1929 international exposition in barcelona spain even replicas of such designs were expensive to produce involving some hand-crafting and retail prices ran into the thousands despite ms knoll’s cost controls the frame of the barcelona chair for example originally nine steel components bolted together was designed as a seamless piece of stainless steel and cowhide instead of pigskin was used for seat and back coverings her exactitude could be frustrating for those who worked under her the website liveauctioneers com said of her in a profile but the fruit of that labor became universally known every time you see barcelona chairs and a table in a lobby that’s her kathryn hiesinger a curator at the philadelphia museum of art told the new york times in 2004 when ms knoll came out of retirement to create

she retired to a private practice in architecture and design in florida in her last decade at knoll the company doubled in size and became one of the nation’s most influential design organizations in 1984 paul goldberger then the architecture critic of the times wrote that ms knoll probably did more than any other single figure to create the modern sleek postwar american office introducing

2021-02-14T19:59:28.847Z - articleBody received: woodstock n.y when the first woodstock music festival was held in 1969 bringing around 400,000 people to a muddy field in bethel n.y it focused the world’s attention on pop music’s power to shape the culture half a century later in a music market already jammed with big-ticket festivals could another woodstock muster the same impact michael lang one of the producers of the original event is betting that it can from aug 16 to 18 almost exactly 50 years after the first woodstock he will present an official anniversary festival woodstock 50 in watkins glen n.y with ambitions to not only attract a huge multigenerational audience but to rally those fans around a message of social activism mr lang who at 74 still has some of the cherubic look seen in the 1970 documentary woodstock though his curls are threaded with gray said in an interview at the festival office in woodstock that he is still booking the acts for the new show he is hoping for a mixture of legacy bands current pop and rap stars and possibly some news-making combinations but his vision for woodstock’s 50th he said is clear a large-scale camping weekend combining music with a program of films speakers and partnerships with organizations like head count which registers young voters coachella’s got its thing as does bonnaroo and lollapalooza mr lang said but i think they’re all missing an opportunity to make a difference in the world they’re all perfect places for social engagement and for fostering ideas and i think that’s lost we want this to be more than just coming to a concert he added and hopefully a lot of the bands will become part of this effort to get people to stand up and make themselves heard to get and out vote and if they don’t have a candidate that represents their feelings to find one or to run themselves yet activism plays a significant part in a number of festivals environmental sustainability is central to bonnaroo for example and this year jay-z’s made in america festival in philadelphia has cause village with some 56 charitable and activist organizations represented woodstock 50 will be held in the fields surrounding the watkins glen international racetrack where the summer jam in 1973 drew an estimated 600,000 people for the grateful dead the allman brothers and the band more recently it has been the site of two festivals by phish for woodstock three main stages will be supplemented by three smaller neighborhoods as mr lang described them with their own food and programming tickets mr lang and his team are still working on that but they envision selling a maximum of around 100,000 three-day passes with most attendees camping on site as with its other anniversary years woodstock’s 50th will be widely celebrated and exploited in the media with books albums and a pbs documentary among the projects planned but unlike the last woodstock anniversary concerts in 1994 and 1999 which mr lang presented along with partners the event now faces severe competition from large-scale festivals around the country coachella lollapalooza and bonnaroo the three biggest are now highly developed brand names with the drawing power to sell out well in advance tickets for coachella’s two weekends for example sold out in a matter of hours last week there is even a competing woodstock the bethel woods music and culture festival over the same anniversary weekend which will also feature ted-style talks will be held on the same grounds as the original around 60 miles from the town of woodstock the watkins glen site is further afield about 30 miles west of ithaca for many concertgoers another issue is whether the woodstock name itself was damaged by the 1999 festival which was marred by fires rioting and reports of sexual assault it’s not tainted mr lang said 99 was more like an mtv event than a woodstock event really i take some responsibility for that it was also kind of an angry time in music and then there is the corporate consolidation of the concert business which has grown especially intense over the last few years as two companies live nation and aeg compete to book major tours live nation is a partner in the bethel woods event the industry has completely changed since 1999 said john scher the veteran concert promoter who was a partner with mr lang on woodstock 94 and 99 the entrepreneurial spirit of 1969 doesn’t exist anymore mr lang declined to discuss the budget for woodstock 50 but festivals of its size typically spend tens of millions on talent alone we paid 135,000 for all of our talent in 1969 mr lang said times have changed the festival is being financed by the dentsu aegis network a unit of the japanese advertising giant dentsu agencies within the dentsu aegis network will be involved in marketing and selling sponsorships one advantage for woodstock 50 is that it is official mr lang remains a partner in woodstock ventures the company that controls the trademark rights and licenses it for various products the one mr lang has been closest to is woodstock cannabis cannabis has always been in our dna mr lang said with a smile his first commercial venture in 1966 was a head shop in the coconut grove neighborhood of miami of the other young men on the team that created woodstock joel rosenman john roberts and artie kornfeld rosenman is a partner in woodstock ventures along with the family of roberts who died in 2001 kornfeld will return as a consultant and spiritual adviser mr lang said merchandise sales particularly featuring the original woodstock bird-and-guitar logo provide one proxy for gauging the continuing appeal of the woodstock brand dell furano the chief executive of epic rights who has handled official woodstock merchandise for 15 years said that he is expecting over 100 million in retail sales of woodstock licensed products in 2019 four or five times that of non-anniversary years there’s every type of tie-dye children’s products dog products speakers wine cannabis mr furano said in an interview the appeal is multigenerational in 1969 the mud the tie-dye and the idealism were all catalysts in creating what the original festival had promised three days of peace and music mr lang said that the divisiveness of the current political climate called for that once again it just seems like it’s a perfect time he said for a woodstock kind of reminder

2021-02-14T19:59:28.960Z - articleBody received: berlin the director steven spielberg cited a renewed cycle of hate in society behind his decision to bring schindler’s list back to movie theaters around the world hoping it would provoke discussion an independent movie theater in western germany embraced that very idea when it offered free tickets to members of the far-right alternative for germany party or afd to its screening of the classic film on jan 27 holocaust remembrance day but some members of the afd whose leaders have dismissed the nazi era as a speck of bird poop in more than 1,000 years of successful german history and have referred to the country’s main holocaust memorial as a monument of shame saw the offer from the cinexx theater more as a provocation than an invitation they have called it a tasteless instrumentalization and a senseless provocation members of left-leaning political parties and others in germany have praised the offer however as justification they point to the afd’s penchant for reciting slogans like germany for the germans for questioning the country’s post-world war ii culture of atonement and for being willing to march alongside neo-nazis during protests in the eastern city of chemnitz the cinexx theater in hachenburg which offered the free viewing last month when it published its january schedule said in a statement we see ourselves as a meeting place films are windows on the world and initiate discussion in society we are in no way asserting that those who vote for the afd are nazis everyone has to judge for themselves whether they need clarification about history the theater said adding that free tickets were regularly offered to different groups including migrants women and children karin leicher who runs the movie theater told the regional broadcaster swr that she realized the offer was provocative but if someone feels the need to insult and threaten us then they obviously feel addressed by it asked about his decision to rerelease the 1993 film mr spielberg said that he saw an increasing need for parents and educators to teach the next generation about the horrors of the holocaust as an antidote to rising anti-semitism with this renewed cycle of hate mr spielberg told the new york times in december i thought it could open up a conversation that genocide can happen anywhere when an ordinary society goes wrong students across the united states were offered free admission to screenings when the film reopened in december a survey released last year found that as time passes knowledge of the nazis mass genocide is receding among adults in the united states in germany where remembrance of the holocaust and the commemoration of its victims have been the cornerstone of a post-world war ii history a recent survey indicated that less than half of people age 18 to 34 said they knew very little about the holocaust

2021-02-14T19:59:29.017Z - articleBody received: [what you need to know to start the day get new york today in your inbox the metoo movement has swept across television and movie studios investment banks and factory floors fundamentally remaking the thinking around gender and harassment has it also swept into a corner of one of the country’s biggest celebrations of irish heritage for the first time since its founding shortly after the revolutionary war a group that puts on a formal dinner to raise money for charity just before the st patrick’s day parade in new york city will allow women to attend specifically the society of the friendly sons of st patrick in the city of new york is inviting the wives daughters sisters mothers aunts nieces and female cousins friends and colleagues of our members to its dinner at the new york hilton it has taken only 235 years and it has only been 30 years since a woman led the st patrick’s day parade as grand marshal for the first time the friendly sons in new york was started to assist irish immigrants and the organization has remained fraternal in the three decades since the city pressured other all-male private clubs to admit women the friendly sons in new york is not officially connected with the st patrick’s day parade on fifth avenue the parade counts 182 affiliated associations but not the friendly sons which has participated in the st patrick’s day parade only once as an organization when soldiers from world war i were returning to civilian life 100 years ago the president of the friendly sons in new york kevin j rooney announced the change in a recent letter to members he did not respond to telephone calls or an email message last week but in the letter he framed the decision as an expansion of the group’s reach he also noted that as irish immigration had declined in recent decades the friendly sons had widened its reach to assist all people regardless of age race ethnicity nationality or religion so he wrote it will again expand its reach this time with regard to the audience it welcomes to the anniversary dinner and welcome women as guests this expansive approach is consistent with our history of supporting all people especially women he wrote adding that in the last decade the society has given more than 2 million to a wide variety of worthy organizations beneficiaries include food pantries homeless shelters job counseling and support programs for veterans and scholarships for poor and middle-class families in every case he wrote women have benefited from the society’s support there are friendly sons groups in other cities and they all operate independently the oldest in philadelphia has been more open to including women in 2016 it admitted anne anderson the irish ambassador to the united states at the time in its first class of 20 women mr rooney the president of the new york society did not say in his letter whether his group had come under pressure to follow philadelphia’s example or whether some members had become uncomfortable about continuing the men-only policy history has caught up with them said one longtime member recalling that when he joined the friendly sons in the 1980s there were cigars at each place setting the cigars were dropped in the 90s but perhaps there was an even more powerful motivation for allowing members to invite women to the dinner boosting numbers and revenue the longtime member who insisted on anonymity said attendance at the dinner declined sharply last year a lot of people don’t want to go without their wives he said there are a lot of women like my wife who said this is about one of the most significant days of the year and you want me to be home alone coming just before st patrick’s day the friendly sons dinner does not have the political overtones of the al smith dinner which is also a white-tie gathering for charity that is held in late fall it is usually an occasion for affable one-liners from politicians or in election years candidates some friendly sons dinners do make news presidents have addressed the group among them harry s truman in 1948 and lyndon b johnson in 1964 less than four months after the assassination of john f kennedy the first irish-catholic elected president there were also lighter moments in 1967 at the 183rd friendly sons dinner mayor john v lindsay and raymond r guest the united states ambassador to ireland at the time addressed the group the mayor noted it was the first time that both principal speakers at this gathering have been certifiable protestants and judging from the weather that blew into town a snowstorm i’m sure it will be a long time before the friendly sons of st patrick make that mistake again the group’s name is a throwback to its colonial-era origins robert j reilly the president in 2004 and 2005 told the society in 2000 that the primary meaning of friendly in colonial america was charitable not pleasant his speech is posted on the society’s website each ethnic group took care of their own mr reilly said the english had the st george’s society the scots had the st andrew’s society the germans had the german society they provided blankets mr reilly said they paid rent they provided food now the friendly sons provide money the group’s filings to the internal revenue service show that it has donated just over 2.3 million since 2009 from as much as 225,000 that year to as little as 131,100 in 2010 for the 12 months that ended on march 31 of last year the figure was 210,000 so a larger turnout a turnout bolstered by allowing women to attend could translate into more money to give away unlike manhattan clubs with the kinds of gemlike hangouts that the gilded age architect stanford white turned into an art form the friendly sons do not have a clubhouse of their own their office funnily enough is in the women’s national republican club building in midtown manhattan itself a landmark that is listed on the national register of historic places but the women will only be guests at the friendly sons dinner mr rooney’s statement announcing an end to a tradition that had become a relic if not an albatross did not say whether the friendly sons would admit women as members that might require a name change ms anderson the former ambassador suggested it several years ago when she told the irish times after a meeting with the friendly sons chapter in washington that she would love to see them evolve toward a new title her suggestion the friendly sons and daughters of st patrick the issue of men-only get-togethers came up again last week when ms anderson was quoted as saying that she was disappointed by the irish prime minister’s response to the idea that irish diplomats should stop attending events run by all-male irish-american groups the prime minister leo varadkar told the irish times that skipping men-only gatherings in the united states could lead to a double standard if irish diplomats continued to attend them elsewhere at the vatican in muslim countries or with lesbian and gay groups it is unusual for a former diplomat to disagree publicly but ms anderson did just that in a radio interview in dublin on friday i don’t think these are appropriate parallels to draw she said on saturday ms anderson suggested that friendly sons groups that had not admitted women could do so by 2021 the 250th anniversary of the philadelphia branch the new york group is younger by 14 years st patrick’s day should be the most inclusive day on our calendar she said in an interview what does it say if these enormous dinners are men only you’re making invisible the contributions of women generations of irish women

2021-02-14T19:59:29.151Z - articleBody received: most new year’s resolutions turn out to be less successful than people expect when they make them starting with high-minded goals for fitness but this is a column about people who make wholesale life changes people with financially solid careers who risk that stability what they share is a single-minded focus on a niche not an overarching vision to change the world monique greenwood is one of them she was the editor in chief of essence magazine her childhood dream job but as she was working on a book having what matters she realized that what she really wanted was to concentrate on what had been a sideline and go into the bed-and-breakfast business i decided i was worth the investment ms greenwood said for lisa congdon the change was less an epiphany she was working in a senior role at an education nonprofit organization and decided to take art classes on the side with zero intention of becoming an artist it was to balance office work some 10 years later she left the stable job to become a commercial artist and illustrator sara bliss author of take the leap change your career change your life said that ms greenwood ms congdon and the other people in her book who did change careers shared a pragmatism about how to make the change even if their reasons varied i think you have to get comfortable with risk because they knew there was risk involved and they needed to put in their all ms bliss said seventy percent of the people are either making the same or more today which surprised me some of the people ms bliss wrote about said they felt they didn’t have other good options judson kauffman spent his 20s as a member of the navy seals doing two tours in iraq and ending his active-duty service as a sniper instructor when he left the navy in 2010 he spent two more years in a civilian role supporting navy recruiting it was very scary to get out mr kauffman now 35 said of leaving the navy the military teaches you how to be soldiers but there isn’t a lot of time put into the transition out after casting around to find a new career he and a fellow navy seal veteran started a firm exbellum to help companies recruit other special operations veterans i had no other options he said i quit my job and no one else was hiring me i had to make it work i’d begun to meet people in business and they said boy we’d love to hire guys like you but there was a disconnect he said the companies weren’t actually hiring those veterans mr kauffman’s firm set out to show companies that engaging in armed conflict was only a small part of what the special operations veterans had done so exbellum highlighted how the veterans were expert at managing personnel logistics and multimillion-dollar budgets at the end of last year he sold the firm to forged consulting in dallas he has since started two other companies one that distills sotol a plant indigenous to texas and another that is in the submarine business we had an adviser who said we could continue growing this and could sell it for a lot to a deloitte or a bain he said of two major consulting firms i made a decision to be a happier person which includes discontinuing things that don’t give me joy the motivation to change careers was different for ms greenwood who had become the editor in chief of essence a few years before she bought her first property she said she had run her first bed-and-breakfast in the bedford-stuyvesant neighborhood of brooklyn while still working for the magazine her husband was also working full time as we got more popular i’d get guests who wanted to come during the week she said we’d ask them what brings you to town if they were coming for a conference we’d say yes because they were on the same schedule as us but if they said we’re coming for our wedding anniversary we’d say we were booked because we couldn’t be there to check them in her nod to pragmatism ended up making that first bed-and-breakfast seem more exclusive than it really was by 2002 ms greenwood was successful enough that she resigned as editor of essence she now has five inns under the akwaaba brand i have accumulated wealth she said i don’t pay me what essence paid me but my wealth is 10 times what it was i have million-dollar real estate i could sell this tomorrow and say it’s o.k others like ms congdon made change incrementally after moving from classroom teaching to working in a nonprofit organization in 2002 she began taking art classes to get more creativity in her life i started taking classes on the side with zero intention of becoming an artist she said it was to balance office work but with the rise of flickr then etsy she put her illustrations and graphic designs online and they began to sell she had a show in seattle in 2006 and sold everything in 2007 a show in new york sold out before it opened by 2011 with a deal to illustrate books her income from art matched her income from her nonprofit work which was in the high five figures her number of etsy followers rising she decided she could leave her other career behind i understood early on that to make a living i couldn’t put all my eggs in one basket and i still do that to a certain extent ms congdon said the difference now is she is earning far more than she did in her previous career through a mix of commercial illustration books lectures and classes online sales alone are well into the six figures not all people made career changes for financial reward after finishing law school at the university of pennsylvania aaron walker joined a corporate law firm but he decided the work wasn’t for him and he switched to an education nonprofit organization then in 2013 he started camelback ventures a nonprofit fund that promotes entrepreneurs of color for roles like portfolio management in impact investing a type of investment with a social conscience there are definitely days when i’m reminded that if i’d stayed at the law firm or done something else i would have made a lot more money in the last five years mr walker said but i get to wake up every morning and do what i want i’ve also made more money in the last 10 years than my mother has made in the last 30 years these people made their career changes voluntarily but others were forced to move out of economic necessity in her late 20s katie warner johnson found herself at a turning point in her career despite professional ballet credentials including a stint in the musical cats and an undergraduate degree from harvard she was working as a trainer in los angeles and had just been rejected by every business school she applied to being a fitness instructor at 80 an hour sounds great but you’re only working 11 to 21 hours a week she said i had no wealth so in 2012 she decided to start a business thinking that it would help her business school application the next time the company which became carbon38 an online store for women’s athletic and leisure apparel started by raising money through the usual route of going to family and friends she then won a venture capital competition which led to additional funding pretty quickly i raised 1 million and i couldn’t exactly go back to business school she said from 2012 to 2016 the company raised 11 million mostly in small checks then foot locker the athletic shoe retailer made a 15 million investment at times she said she marvels at how much the company has grown in five years just in the last year it has doubled in size and now has close to 100 full-time employees i’m a dancer we pick up choreography very quickly she

years of agonizing negotiation has been rejected by a margin of 230 votes in the worst defeat in british history no deal no hope no clue no confidence declares the mirror the sun photoshops her face onto the body of a dodo now it’s wednesday afternoon hey she’s back what is brexit a simple guide to why it matters and what happens next the labour party is making a bid to dissolve the government leaping to mrs may’s defense like gallant knights are fellow tories among them many who have spent the last few months plotting to remove her she personifies duty she is a patriot and a servant of our country said one another praised her inspirational leadership yet another predicted that her stock in this country will rise dramatically this is the bizarro world that is british politics a groundhog day in which mrs may awakes every day to discover herself in a dire political crisis and every day survives in her grim implacable way the rallying of tories against labour’s bid to bring down the government which was defeated by a margin of 19 votes did it again the thing that had seemed impossible it put wind into her sails she is indestructible wrote tom peck a sketch writer for the independent reflecting on the events of the day she is the cockroach in nuclear winter she is the algae that survives on sulphuric gas from subaquatic volcanoes seven miles beneath the daylight she is the nokia 5210 mrs may rarely gives any sense of being chastened by a defeat plowing ahead in the manner that earned her the nickname maybot stewart mcdonald a member of the scottish national party grilled her on wednesday for signs that she was ready to reconsider her brexit strategy she did not comply responding with a set of now-familiar automatic phrases like deliver brexit for the british people which sent mr mcdonald into a spasm of frustration nobody knows really but these are the likeliest scenarios i’m trying to be helpful to the prime minister believe it or not but this is pure robotic fantasy mr mcdonald said he grumbled about it later on twitter writing i tried but alas the robot within the pm kicked in and she stuck to her script the day provided a number of surreal moments that tested the nation’s storied capacity for calm at one point parliament broke away from the nonstop constitutional brush fire surrounding brexit the guardian chose to augment its masthead on wednesday with a reproduction of edvard munch’s the scream to address an obscure motion banning the excessively low positioning of letter boxes postmen complain that low letter boxes can cause back pain or even occasionally hand injuries explained a lawmaker vicky ford who noted with admiration that several european countries also regulate the size of letter box apertures i hope this will be a moment of unity in british politics she said brightly ten minutes and it was back to the meltdown of british democracy as conservative lawmakers lined up to express their loyalty to mrs may vicki young the bbc’s chief political correspondent marveled at their pivot from the day before when many among them had been gleefully plotting to sink her hard-won brexit deal their circling of the wagons she concluded was tribal as frustrated as they are with mrs may conservatives are desperate to avoid a change of government that would put jeremy corbyn the head of the labour party in office many of them feel sympathy for her as well believing that she was given an impossible task it feels like a parallel universe doesn’t it considering where we were last night just 24 hours ago she said i have to say looking at the scenes in the last half-hour or so it’s the most united the conservative benches have been probably for months a notable tribute to mrs may came from conservative lawmaker mark francois a leader of the arch-brexiteer european research group mr francois in november submitted a scathing letter to the party’s 1922 committee which has the power to remove the party leader saying mrs may just doesn’t listen and is in complete denial since then he has missed no opportunity to criticize her deal which he described as rancid and complained that instead of submitting the deal to a vote members of her government had gone and run away and hidden in the toilet on wednesday mr francois stood in her defense acknowledging to widespread laughter that she and i have not seen entirely eye to eye in the past but i am a conservative first and last and i know opportunism when i see it he said i can tell you when the bells ring the whole of the erg will walk through the lobbies with her to vote this nonsense down the failed challenge to mrs may’s leadership came at just the right time drawing attention away from the dismal failure of her brexit bill said nikki da costa a former downing street staffer who now works as senior counsel for the cicero group a consulting firm without a doubt it is a wonderful distraction she said it moves the news story forward very very quickly it does not however resolve the matter at hand on the heels of her crushing defeat on tuesday mrs may vowed to forge a deal that could win passage but declined to offer specifics there is speculation that she could seek a postponement of the march 29 deadline and agree to keep a permanent customs union with the european bloc she said on wednesday that she would invite opposition party leaders to discuss a compromise but mr corbyn asked her to first rule out leaving the european union without any agreement when historians relate the story of brexit they may not even recall tuesday’s epic defeat as the most important event of the week one thing is certain mrs may’s survival provides a certain ballast as this process moves forward ms da costa said as the years go by and the 24-hour news cycle passes it will be interesting to know which bits stand in the memory she said certainly the numbers for her defeat were very very big yesterday the fact that she is still standing suggests a strange form of stability

2021-02-14T19:59:29.553Z - articleBody received: i always admired my uncle anas my mom’s youngest brother and a general in the egyptian police he helped shape my sense of justice and discipline when i was growing up i had nothing but respect and admiration for him and his work fighting bad guys throughout his career and unlike many of his colleagues he never believed he was above the law in a country where corruption is practically a way of life he refused to wave his badge to get out of paying the train fare or to avoid everyday inconveniences he genuinely believed that the police were there to maintain order and serve the people then a coup came between us after egypt’s generals overthrew president mohamed morsi in july 2013 i started attending and live-tweeting the huge sit-in in cairo protesting the restoration of military rule just 30 months after egyptians had risen up against it on aug 14 of that year police and soldiers including my uncle’s unit surrounded and attacked the sprawling protest camp at least 800 people were killed some estimates put the number at more than 1,000 and some 4,000 more were injured i was one of them as the police cleared the sit-in that morning i was shot in the arm a few days later the police broke into my parents home looking for my father who served in mr morsi’s government instead i was arrested a few weeks later my father was arrested too i counted on uncle anas to come to my rescue while rotting in solitary confinement i had many daydreams about him knocking down the prison walls to save me my father and our fellow prisoners from torture and abuse but he never came why did he abandon us in the months before the coup egypt became pitted against itself those who supported ousting mr morsi including their backers in the state media had dehumanized a large subset of egyptian society the muslim brotherhood and anyone believed to be sympathetic to them i felt the tension rising at every family or social gathering where small disagreements took on a new viciousness anti-revolution rhetoric cloaked itself in anti-islamism and conspiracy theories were everywhere the muslim brotherhood was painted as the diabolical enemy of their fellow countrymen i am not a member of the muslim brotherhood my father a respected authority on islamic jurisprudence lived most of his life outside of egypt but was affiliated with a progressive moderate vision of islamism most important we both opposed the coup i can only guess that my uncle thought the stability of egypt required him to stand by the crackdown or that he was afraid of associating with his now-dissident relatives he never came not even to visit even though a visit from him could have eased the conditions of my imprisonment with every insult every incident of torture my resentment grew how could my own uncle sleep in the comfort of his home knowing his nephew and brother-in-law were facing so much injustice he was supposed to be better than the rest to maintain sanity i suppressed my memories of the massacre and displaced the pain of my imprisonment into anger toward my uncle i lashed out at my mother during her brief prison visits when she would make excuses for him and apologetically suggest that he might come by once things cooled down a bit i blamed him and every other officer who worked for the regime hate was the simplest solution a 489-day hunger strike an international campaign and pressure from washington helped me regain my freedom on may 30 2015 i felt more solidarity from strangers than i did from some of my own blood relatives a few months after my release my uncle was severely injured in a suspected terrorist attack in sinai where he was stationed my mother implored me to offer sympathy i refused to call i almost felt a sense of justice two years later uncle anas was still unable to walk it had been nearly a year since he had surgery for a spinal fracture he sustained as a result of the attack and his muscles had not recovered medical exams revealed a fatal diagnosis amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or a.l.s a degenerative illness i still could not bring myself to call my uncle but as i watched my mother grieve i began to rethink i came to realize that in my self-righteous pursuit of justice i had committed injustice against myself and my loved ones my resentment blinded me to what was truly important my empathy and humanity i had dehumanized one of my most beloved just as he had dehumanized me i was angry at him for abandoning me while i was in prison yet when he became a prisoner of his own body i was ready to abandon him last summer i made peace with my uncle it was the most difficult experience i have had since i left prison i called him on the first day of eid and i could hear the slightly panicked excitement in his voice as we exchanged greetings he spoke faster than usual as if trying to make up for lost time the weight of the resentment i carried vanished as soon as the conversation turned to kids marriage health and the famous feast that my aunt makes every eid as i ended our five years of silence i felt the same sensation of freedom i had experienced when i was released soon after my mom told me that the call had done wonders for his morale and that he had accompanied her on a visit to my father who remains in prison my father served in the morsi government i was imprisoned for my activism my uncle was a police officer under successive regimes many other family members were army generals or politicians under the government of the former president hosni mubarak is my family unique in many ways not at all most egyptian families are similarly split across the country’s political divides with rampant state violence and the absence of any semblance of justice egyptian society is beyond polarized it is broken the targeting and dehumanization has extended beyond islamists now anyone who dares to challenge the status quo is demonized families remain strained political differences seem existential dinner tables still have empty seats many weddings birthdays and funerals are missed because of imprisonment exile or exclusion the hate anger and vengeance have somehow overrun human decency i don’t know how egypt will heal but i do know that it will begin with each of us finding the strength to let love and hope transcend hate and grievance even though i may never get to see my favorite uncle again i am prohibited from re-entering egypt and he won’t be able to make it to the united states a single phone call proved a powerful antidote to the venom we had been fed my uncle and i took back the humanity that was stripped away from us with a simple act of love mohamed soltan soltanlife is the founder of the freedom initiative an advocacy group for prisoners of conscience

2021-02-14T20:04:52.155Z - articleBody received: tokyo carlos ghosn and his lawyers are laying out the most comprehensive case yet for his innocence nearly two months after his arrest shook the auto business and tarnished his reputation as an industry titan still it may not be enough to free him from jail for months as prosecutors try to build a case against the ousted nissan motor chairman and onetime leader of an automaking juggernaut that builds more than 10 million cars annually mr ghosn’s chief defense lawyer in japan said on tuesday that prosecutors had no basis for holding him in jail on allegations that he had improperly transferred personal losses to nissan’s books saying that board members had approved the transactions late tuesday that lawyer motonari otsuru submitted a request to the court to release mr ghosn from detention on the grounds that nissan did not ultimately bear any losses and that he was not a flight risk the moves came hours after mr ghosn appeared in court on tuesday his first public appearance since his arrest on nov 19 mr ghosn 64 fought back against the allegations which include charges that he had failed to report his full compensation from nissan in filings with regulators he declared that he had acted honorably legally and with the knowledge and approval of the appropriate executives inside the company the defense sets the stage for what could be a lengthy legal battle between mr ghosn and japanese prosecutors and mr ghosn may remain in custody for months mr otsuru a former prosecutor said it was possible mr ghosn could spend up to six more months in jail as it was typical for japanese courts to detain suspects until the start of their trials there are documents that have to be investigated in both japanese and english which will take time mr otsuru said six months will be needed before being able to go to trial mr ghosn has been in jail since his arrest throwing into turmoil a vast alliance of nissan mitsubishi motors of japan and renault of france nissan which removed mr ghosn as chairman that month has said that its investigation into his actions uncovered substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct and that its scope continues to broaden last month mr ghosn and nissan itself were indicted on charges that they had withheld millions of dollars of his income from nissan’s financial filings for years when he was both chairman and chief executive of the company mr ghosn and his lawyers portrayed him on tuesday as a dedicated executive committed to overseeing the alliance his actions they said were disclosed to and approved by other company officials in his statement to the court mr ghosn said he had never received any compensation from nissan that was not disclosed late last month he was rearrested on the allegations that he had improperly transferred investment losses to nissan and his detention was extended mr otsuru said at a news conference that nissan’s own board minutes showed the company had agreed that nissan would temporarily provide collateral for mr ghosn when he incurred deep paper losses on foreign exchange investments after the financial crisis of 2008 the board minutes have not been publicly released in a statement submitted to the court for the hearing on tuesday mr ghosn’s defense lawyers described the board minutes as authorizing a nissan secretarial section to enter into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of non-japanese corporate officers and directors at no cost to the company mr ghosn the statement said had asked the board to pass a resolution with general language that did not specifically include his name so that he would not have to explain the situation where he had to pay for significant losses as the suspect if possible did not want to have all of the people attending the board meeting to know that he had incurred significant valuation losses mr otsuru said that nissan had entered into an agreement with mr ghosn and a bank that had lent mr ghosn money but that the agreements were explicitly designed to shield nissan itself from any losses at the time of the transfer being made to nissan it was made clear that any losses would be borne by mr ghosn mr otsuru said the most recent arrest also focused on allegations that mr ghosn had improperly used nissan funds to pay a saudi businessman to provide collateral for mr ghosn’s investment losses in his court statement mr ghosn said that nissan had paid the businessman khaled juffali for critical services that substantially benefited nissan mr otsuru told reporters that the businessman whom he declined to name at the news conference had provided 3 billion yen about 31 million at the time as collateral for mr ghosn in 2009 but he reiterated that nissan’s payments to the businessman’s company were for legitimate services such as helping to negotiate disputes with a saudi distributor or soliciting investments in nissan nissan said in a statement that it was not in a position to comment on the content of allegations made by the tokyo public prosecutors office or rebuttals of such allegations the company is complying with requests to aid the discovery process in the ongoing criminal investigation mr otsuru played down speculation put forward by mr ghosn’s own children that the auto executive’s arrest and ouster were the result of a revolt by his former nissan colleagues as a former prosecutor i am certain that the prosecution would not investigate a case that for example would tilt the scales in favor of a particular side in a nissan power struggle mr otsuru said he added that mr ghosn had not been asked to sign a confession in japanese that he did not understand contradicting an assertion made by anthony ghosn mr ghosn’s son in an interview with the french newspaper journal du dimanche over the weekend not once has mr ghosn expressed concerns about being asked to sign anything that he doesn’t understand mr otsuru said anthony ghosn declined to comment according to devon spurgeon a spokeswoman for the family since he was arrested coming off his corporate jet mr ghosn has been kept in a small cell in tokyo where he is not allowed to speak with his family and is limited to talking with diplomats and his japanese lawyers his lawyers cannot be present when prosecutors question him mr otsuru said he met with mr ghosn for about two and a half hours every day he is a very logical person mr otsuru said he wants to use this time as effectively as possible he doesn’t speak with us about whether his room is small or his bed is uncomfortable he wants to use this time with his lawyers effectively for the purpose of the investigation

good-natured sprite who mere weeks earlier thought that the park sounded like a delightful prospect and was happy to get ready to go the time comes in any relationship when the initial infatuation dampens a bit the beloved’s behavior gets a bit annoying the sense that you’re in accord on everything begins to erode you find yourself sparring about things that never used to divide you with my granddaughter bartola that’s a pet name honoring the former mets pitcher bartolo colon that shift happened predictably a few months after she turned 2 as her thursday day care provider i was used to her routines and preferences but not to this prickly behavior me reasonably would you like some blackberries bartola at a decibel level suggesting violations of the geneva conventions no no blackberries no blackberries the sight of a jacket sends her hurtling in the other direction diaper changes can become pitched battles most of the time i can jolly her out of her opposition or wait out her squawks of protest but one day while we were out bartola refused to follow the rules her parents had set either you hold a grownup’s hand while you’re walking down a crowded city sidewalk or you ride in the stroller this is a safety issue something you can’t back down from so after several ignored warnings as she tried to twist away i had to plop her into her stroller already tall for her age bartola is getting stronger our struggle became less about plopping and more about wrestling and it got loud and tearful a genuine meltdown i half expected passers-by to report me to the authorities i try not to take this stuff personally bartola also at times defies her parents who bought her an earnest board book called feet are not for kicking part of a series i’ve learned that also includes teeth are not for biting and hands are not for hitting her parents have read feet are not for kicking to her roughly 35,000 times i’ve read it to her too she likes the book it has had no detectable effect spending time each week with a toddler not only tests one’s patience it also challenges the immune system i’m forever coming down with a cold or recovering from one i used to go a year or longer between viral illnesses now they seem to assault me every other month it’s not that i’m particularly susceptible it’s that toddlers are disease vectors they can get eight to 10 colds a year more if they’re in day care centers as bartola is three days a week a doctor friend jennifer brokaw taught me the perfect word for this attribute when i was as usual on the tail end of a cold fomite it’s a medical term for something that transmits infection and while it usually refers to an inanimate object like a stethoscope doctors sometimes jokingly talk about patients that way too so now i no longer refer to bartola as the walking petri dish i just call her the fomite of course these same trials plagued me and all grandparents when our own kids were small at about the same age bartola’s mother also liked to kick at whoever was trying to put her shoes on i remember being sick a lot too when she started pre-k in fact a pediatrician friend maintained that the true purpose of early childhood education was to confer immunity so that our kids wouldn’t miss every fourth day when they started real school parents however don’t have a choice about dealing with toddlers they have to get their kids dressed fed and bathed even if those routine tasks produce shrieks and sobs they have to live with their fomites and suffer the health consequences they’ve signed up for exhaustion but most grandparents don’t our exposure is voluntary i choose to trek from my new jersey apartment to brooklyn every week i could instead claim that for the next few months when do the terrible twos end anyway i’ll be too snowed under by work too sick or too weary i could tell my daughter and son-in-law i did this once already i could say i need a break see you in april i’m not going to say any of that of course on the day my daughter told me she was pregnant i responded with a request to claim the name bubbe it’s yiddish for grandmother and an offer to serve as a weekly day care provider i remembered the frazzled feelings of those early years when two young parents can barely make time for anything besides working and baby-ing my own parents and in-laws couldn’t help much they all lived hours away now i’m the only one of bartola’s grandparents close enough to take on this role where i don’t just sympathize with her parents attempts to help her kick her kicking habit but join the campaign i cherish the opportunity even as i sometimes mutter about the particulars partly i’m sticking around because even on her more obnoxious days bartola and i have lovely times she’s a fully verbal little person now for better and sometimes for worse so we have extended conversations we share private jokes and invent songs she understands make-believe so we can take out her bucket and shovel and pretend we’re at the beach making imaginary sand castles and watching invisible sea gulls overhead that’s worth a fair amount of kicking in fact on some thursdays just to keep me off balance she reverts to her previously cheerful self time to put shoes on sure no problem psych partly i’m sticking around because children need consistency from the adults who love them and because family relationships give adults lives meaning too we’ll have future disputes inevitably i’ll infuriate and disappoint bartola now and then just as she sometimes grates on me and relationships change more experienced grandparents have talked about the sinking feeling when the kid who used to come racing into their arms gets older and barely glances up from his video game when grandma and grandpa arrive that has to hurt especially when grandparents have traveled some distance but can it justify our staying away i’m not at that point yet but i don’t think so on a tuesday last month my daughter emma asked bartola if she knew what day it was bubbe day she yelled well no the correct answer was daddy’s birthday but once a toddler recognizes there’s such a thing as bubbe day even though illness or other obstacles may one day intervene bubbe had better keep showing up for her shift commitments are not for breaking paula span writes the new old age column in the science section of the new york

but on this particular morning in kandy a small city in the center of sri lanka i was looking for someone to take me on a tour of the sights santha a small middle-aged man with a big smile must have sensed it because he made a beeline for me as i approached the small park near the kandy municipal market on sri wickrama rajasinghe mawatha street in the center of town after a quick negotiation we were off crammed into the back of a blue tuk-tuk zooming down streets slick from the morning’s rain and smelling of wet leaves santha yelled to me over the loud buzz of the auto rickshaw’s engine i was born in kandy raised in kandy and married in kandy he added and i will die in kandy i could easily have spent months in sri lanka the small island nation off the southern tip of india full of fantastic food kind people and astonishing natural wonder sri lanka is a place best seen slowly even if you only have four days on the ground like i did the train was my preferred means of transport when i wasn’t in a tuk-tuk winding from colombo to kandy in the middle of the country before taking another train down to ella on what was one of the most beautiful and scenic train rides i’ve ever experienced and as far as cost goes i was able to keep my expenses comfortably under control first some logistics a train trip in sri lanka requires planning many popular routes including the one from kandy to ella can sell out reserved seats weeks in advance the sri lanka railways website isn’t going to be much help here you can only reserve tickets in person or through your local mobile phone i consulted the website the man in seat 61 and eventually decided to place my trust in visit sri lanka tours to make my bookings my ticket in the observation car from colombo to kandy with comfortable seats and a big picture window at the front of the compartment cost 11 british pounds or about 14 for the two-and-a-half hour ride the agency is u.k.-based and charges in pounds payable through paypal i snagged the last reserved second-class seat on the kandy to ella route this is with booking 20 days in advance and paid 13 pounds for the more ponderous nearly seven-hour jaunt through the green hills and tea plantations of central sri lanka the airtel sim card i purchased in india didn’t work when i landed at bandaranaike international airport on my srilankan airlines flight about 180 for a one-way flight from chennai india luckily i had bought an ais travel sim card for about 18 ahead of time which is good for eight consecutive days of travel in over a dozen asian countries including sri lanka i can’t speak for service in the other countries on the list but i had no trouble plugging it into my unlocked iphone and using it over the next several days in sri lanka i picked up my ticket at colombo’s fort railway station and had just enough time to stop at the nearby highland milk bar for a quick snack a creamy chocolate milk from a glass bottle and a bag of chips cost me 120 sri lankan rupees or about 65 cents the first part of the ride heading east was unexceptional but things changed around rambukkana suddenly the air seemed heavier and the vegetation became thicker and denser as we passed each successive train station painted in muted pastels pelting rain greeted us as we entered kandy once its own independent kingdom on the island until it fell victim to british colonial power in the early 19th century i put on a poncho i’d brought for the occasion and walked down william gopallawa mawatha street in search of my lodgings gamage i asked passers-by unsure how to pronounce the name of the family who was hosting me eventually someone pointed me toward a fluorescent light inside a small grocery and i sloshed toward it a woman peered out the door and waved peterson she yelled from across the street the lovely gamage family pronounced gah-mah-gay consisting of parents children and extended family all under one roof put me up for two nights in their home for about 10 per night booked through the site hotels.com my room was basic but comfortable and came with an outstanding breakfast spread every morning curried mango daal beans beets rice eggs and tea mrs gamage told me i could easily find someone in a tuk-tuk to show me around town when i found santha the next day near the park or rather he found me we quickly agreed on a price for a tour of the city 2,000 rupees a little more than 11 we have very good history here he said to me as the tuk-tuk labored uphill toward sri mahabodhi maha viharaya buddhist temple a little over a mile from the town center sri lanka is a majority buddhist nation and many of the culturally and historically significant places of worship are buddhist after spending some time admiring the giant statue of buddha that the temple is famous for and paying the 250-rupee entrance fee santha our driver and i made a few more stops in the area some were clearly an attempt to get me to buy something but i didn’t mind at the pilimathalawa tea factory for example a quick and interesting tour of the grounds was followed by an elaborate tasting and sales pitch to try to get me to buy tea when i bought a package of broken orange pekoe tea for 1,200 rupees which i was going to buy anyway the salesman immediately said that if i bought a second one i’d get the third for free he balked when i suggested he give me one package for 800 rupees however and i walked out with my single package of tasty locally grown tea after a visit to a government-run medicinal garden and a stop for a quick beer 100 rupees buys you a local anchor beer from the supermarket we zoomed back toward town santha narrating as we went along very dirty right now he said as we crossed a muddy-looking mahaweli river why would i choose to visit sri lanka now during rainy season he asked me i didn’t have a good answer the royal botanic gardens was the final stop on our tour despite the relatively hefty entrance fee 1,500 rupees for foreigners 60 for locals i found the gardens a lovely respite from the traffic and hubbub of the area they seem more like an arboretum than anything else and i admired mazelike java fig trees a towering smooth-barked kauri and a fascinating cannonball tree which holds dozens of large spherical fruits the food is wonderful in sri lanka bright flavors sharp spices and complex curries usually eaten with rice as the centerpiece i thoroughly enjoyed the flavors of sri lanka cooking class i booked as an airbnb experience 22 with the friendly chitra taking the lead and her daughter hasara assisting learning about the different spices and produce was a delicious and elucidating education like gotu kola an herb and goraka a small sharply acidic fruit that’s commonly dried and used to flavor meat and fish a 400-rupee tuk-tuk ride from chitra’s house on the western side of town took me to sri dalada maligawa or temple of the sacred tooth relic 1,500 rupees admission just in time for the 6:30 p.m puja or worship ceremony hundreds of people packed into the temple fragrant with flowers and ringing with the rhythm of drums beaten by men in traditional dress after the puja i wandered north along a narrow moat until i came to a man standing in front of an old regal-looking building he introduced himself as vipula and we chatted about the building which was the residence of kandy’s king until the british seized the kingdom in 1815 the king vipula said sadly was betrayed by his own people after an early breakfast the next morning i boarded a bright blue train to ella a small town southeast of kandy traveling by train is one of my favorite ways to get to know a place while allowing one to truly have a sense of moving from one place to another it also creates a sense of community and shared experience with others aboard from my second-class seat about 16.50 again booked through visit sri lanka tours i could enjoy the percussive clacking of the train as it wound through the intensely lush hilly terrain with row after row of perfectly manicured tea plants dotting every slope with tourists and locals hanging out of the doors and windows some to get a good selfie others to get some air we pulled into ella station i made the short walk to the sunnyside holiday bungalow where i had booked a room for just under 30 per night the owners are kind and the property with gardens and a big shaded porch is beautiful the one downside is that there seems to be a trash processing facility across the road which can be slightly irksome when the wind blows the wrong way ella’s downtown is geared to tourists and backpackers think western-style coffee shops bars and souvenir stores so i didn’t spend much time there my first morning in ella i set out to find the nine arch bridge a gorgeous old colonial-era railway bridge that has as you might expect nine big arches i was fortunate to arrive just as a big red and green engine with a few cars behind it came barreling around the bend after a morning of walking around it started to pour i ducked into the restaurant at the 98 acres resort spa which sits atop a hill and provides an awesome view of the surrounding countryside even in the rain i sipped a cappuccino 400 rupees and lamented the weather but an hour or so later i had my chance the downpour had eased to a light smattering and i set out to hike little adam’s peak a slightly rigorous but very doable trek to the south it was a bit more difficult after the rain but the trade-off is that i had it all to myself i didn’t meet a soul on the way up nor was there anyone at the summit i approached a small shrine that had a covered golden buddha statue and multicolored prayer flags fluttering lightly and admired the vista of low-lying clouds resting gently on what seemed like an endless series of rolling green hills even through the rain it was a spectacular sight follow ny times travel on twitter instagram and facebook get weekly updates

2021-02-14T20:04:52.980Z - articleBody received: my sister divorced her husband years ago until recently we remained on friendly terms with my former brother-in-law socializing at family events he hosted and exchanging holiday gifts lately he has become so radical in his political and world views that i am no longer comfortable maintaining a relationship he has a blog and is an occasional radio host so his are very public opinions that are filled with hate and even calls to violent action i find this horrifying and i am firmly in the category of people he is calling for violence against along with most of my family this is more than simply differing ideologies i do not believe he is a physical danger i believe he needs help the way alex jones needs help my question is this do i tell him that his behavior offends me and i wish to cut off contact or do i simply decline invitations and cease sending gifts is one behavior more ethical than the other name withheld one reflection of our country’s toxic partisanship is that families may now find dinner-table conversations about politics impossible yet if people can’t talk about the things that divide us with their families where there’s a background assumption that you should try to stick together even when you disagree you’ve got to wonder where they can so i’d be inclined to have a go at talking to this fellow about his noxious opinions letting him know what you think if most of his political discussions are in the echo chamber of social media and on a right-wing radio station you and your family may be the only fellow citizens of his who have a chance to make him consider other points of view supposing that he doesn’t respond reasonably the likeliest outcome no doubt you can tell him that you’re breaking off with him and he’ll know your reasons but at least you’ll have treated him respectfully both as someone you had a family connection with and as a fellow american citizen seeing him as needing help though suggests that you think he’s mentally ill of course it’s possible that he is but his views may have just been heightened by the extreme rhetoric that circulates in social media nowadays if that’s the case it’s not him individually but our civic culture that’s in need of help casting a social phenomenon as an individual pathology is a perilous temptation you can see it in the movement now afoot to medicalize racism as a mental disorder in crazy times you can have crazy views without being insane like family members fellow citizens in a democracy have to be committed to trying to work things out because we are supposed to be running the republic together abandon that precept and you undermine the moral basis of our common american citizenship your ex-in-law in his hate-mongering has done so your first response should be to try to uphold it since graduating from college in 2013 i have been paying off my student loans my payment plan has been level and i pay the same amount every month this past month there was 10,000 credited to my account i examined my checking account to confirm that i hadn’t accidentally overdrafted it i hadn’t do i have any obligation to inform the loan collector of this mistake for obvious reasons i’m hesitant to get in touch with them but i’m also worried that this could eventually come back to me plus interest should i inquire and hope the loan collector doesn’t undo this surprising mistake name withheld yes do inquire you could discover that the credit was intentional and you’re entitled to it guilt-free worst case you owe exactly what you thought you owed but it’s wrong to take advantage of what you believe to be an error despite that slightly worrying observation that you’re hesitant to get in touch with the loan collector for obvious reasons you’re writing because you’re troubled by the situation you find yourself in you’re basically an honest person best to stay that way i live in a two-story apartment building in toronto the building is old and the ceilings are quite thin i have always heard the footsteps of my upstairs neighbors a family of three with a husband a wife and one son recently over the course of a week i heard loud intercourse through my ceiling the woman’s moans were hard to ignore it got to the point where i decided to text the wife at 12:30 a.m when the moans were disturbing my sleep please be aware we have thin ceilings thank you the following morning i got a response saying that she was out of town apologizing for the noise and indicating that she would pass on the message to her husband the wife was out of town yet i heard sex crazy loud sex it hit me her husband was sleeping with another womanshould i tell the wife what i heard and expose the cheater or do i let him get away with his immoral actions do i withhold this life-changing potentially marriage-ending secret even though it seems wrong not to inform her of his wrongdoings name withheld you don’t say anything about your relationship with your upstairs neighbors if she were your close friend and he wasn’t you would clearly have greater responsibilities to her than to him friendship should lead you to tell her even though the discovery might disturb her greatly otherwise you’d be betraying a relationship of trust by keeping her in the dark if they’re both your friends you might feel torn but if they’re merely acquaintances as appears to be the case you might prefer to stay out of it you’d have no special obligations to either of them after all for all you know they have an open marriage and the wife in alerting her husband to the noise complaint was aware of the activity if not its amplitude even if it is the sort of marriage-threatening misbehavior you take it to be you’re not required to be an informant conversely you’d be perfectly within your rights to share what you think you heard just bear in mind that doing so might create a ruckus of another sort i am in my mid-70s and have been happily married to my second husband for 40 years when i was in college i met a young man who was smart and funny we each had difficult childhoods and were lonely our loneliness drew us together and ultimately we fell in love and married i was too immature and confused and should not have married but for all intents and purposes we were happy he was a good person and treated me well we were married for a little over two years when i decided that i did not want to be married anymore i really blindsided him literally walking into our apartment one day and saying that i wanted to leave him he was surprised and hurt but did not pressure me to stay i told him it might not be permanent and we stayed friends for a while and it was during this period that i realize in retrospect i treated him especially badly for a long time i have felt that i would like to apologize he didn’t deserve the pain that i caused him the breakup was not due to anything he did or didn’t do it was all me because he has a public presence i know how to reach him but i am concerned that an apology after all these years would not be appropriate it might cause him more pain and i certainly don’t want that is an apology always the ethical choice given that i have no contact with anyone from that period in my life i have no way of knowing how he might feel about hearing from me name withheld apologies are centrally about repairing relationships you may think it’s very unlikely that this man will want to re-establish the relationship and if that’s so the only serious effect of the apology will be to cause him whatever distress might come from revisiting a painful episode or whatever relief might come from your it’s not you it’s me assurances neither the fact that in some sense you owe him an apology nor the fact that apologizing might make you feel better settles the matter of what you should do in short the answer to your question is no apology isn’t always the ethical choice when an apology from the remote past would simply unearth anguished memories the right choice may be reticence

bring her literal translations into a more vivid and robust english it’s a process that requires listening to the work out loud and deciding on subtle shifts in tone and emphasis i’m currently

2021-02-14T20:16:57.491Z - articleBody received: [what you need to know to start the day get new york today in your inbox several years ago before confederate monuments came toppling down amid collective recognition that american public space needed a politicized renovation a group of women in new york city started a fund to build a statue in central park honoring women’s suffrage memorializing any woman at all was going to be novel because once you got past alice in wonderland who was there really as it happens there is not a single statue of a nonfictional woman in the entire park one of the most heavily visited tourist sites in the world with more than 25 million people passing through each year and yet the list of the commemorated is copious enough to include king wladyslaw jagiello the 14th-century grand duke of lithuania at which point you might ask yourself where is barney greengrass given this myopia and absence of logic it is easy to see how the decision to erect a statue of susan b anthony and elizabeth cady stanton on the mall the widest pedestrian path in the park might be considered an innovation last summer the city in partnership with the statue fund as it came to be called announced that a design for such a sculpture had been selected following a competition that had received 91 submissions the monument to be unveiled in 2020 in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment which granted women the right to vote would feature renditions of the two women best known for helping to secure that right that the suffrage movement was big broad and diverse is meant to be reflected in the image of a scroll unfolding between anthony and stanton like a very long to-do list procure more rolled oats seek equality naming and quoting 22 other women whose contributions were greatly significant of the 22 women selected seven are african-american some of them sojourner truth ida b wells mary church terrell stand as towering figures in the history of american social activism and yet none is set to receive a statue of her own in this configuration in effect the monument a maquette of which is on display in albany manages to recapitulate the marginalization black women experienced during the suffrage movement to begin with when to cite but one example they were forced by white organizers to congregate in the back during a famous women’s march in washington in 1913 coinciding with woodrow wilson’s inauguration while you might think that gloria steinem who has been appalled by the invisibility of women in new york city’s public art for decades might be delighted by the arrival of a suffrage monument her grievance has outweighed any enthusiasm it is not only that it is not enough she told me recently it’s that it looks as if anthony and stanton are standing on the names of these other women other prominent women have raised the same issue more literally the inclusion of the scroll and the way that the women are positioned toward it suggests they are writing the history of suffrage which is in itself problematic because anthony and stanton were two of the coeditors on a six volume compendium the history of women’s suffrage that gave them ownership of a narrative that erased the participation of black women in the movement though many suffragists came to social justice through abolitionism they maintained explicit prejudices arguing against the notion of black men receiving suffrage at the expense of white women stanton once said that it was better to be the slave of an educated white man than of a degraded black one ms steinem made her feelings known to those involved with the statue fund she said but was told essentially that things were too far along to change course i do think we cannot have a statue of two white women representing the vote for all women she told me for its part the parks department seems disinclined to mandate any major revisions when i spoke with jonathan kuhn the department’s director of art and antiquities he said that the statue though still under review by a public design commission could be altered only in terms of small detail adding another figure would be a different project he said changing things substantially would compromise the artist’s vision but that vision was narrowly circumscribed by the monument’s benefactors to begin with they had asked for statues of anthony and stanton that would allude to the work of others a conceptual piece might have made clearer how large and diverse the suffrage movement was but the department would not allow an overtly modern or conceptual artwork it is a very conservative place said meredith bergmann the sculptor ultimately chosen her original design featured a digital kiosk that would have provided more context and information about the movement but that was nixed she told me instead an online educational campaign will accompany the unveiling of the statue although the city has recently moved to add more women and people of color to its supply of civic art a statue of shirley chisholm is now planned for prospect park just two years ago the parks department asked a sculptor to remove a noose from a piece about racial hatred that was set to go up in riverside park because it might offend people doing yoga and pilates nearby after much public criticism the department allowed the noose in the end the women behind the statue fund are white well-intentioned feminists of a certain vintage they will remind you that they have worked hard for years without pay to make this statue a reality that the controversy saddens them because weren’t they doing a good thing when i called pam elam the president of the fund one of the first things she told me was that she gave her first speech on women’s rights when she was 13 the bottom line is we are committed to inclusion she said but you can’t ask one statue to meet all the desires of the people who have waited so long for recognition so much has changed though in just the past six or seven years since the idea for the monument was conceived that insisting on old ways of doing and seeing things feels like a new betrayal those involved might begin by understanding inclusion as more than a buzzword and commit to evolving their views as the truths of history reveal themselves what is forward-moving about reiterating an error in an effort to correct for it

2021-02-14T20:16:57.770Z - articleBody received: [what you need to know to start the day get new york today in your inbox when mayor bill de blasio acknowledged this month that his administration had kept secret that a former chief of staff was forced to resign after two women accused him of sexual harassment the mayor said he was shocked and sickened by the aide’s conduct but it turns out that barely a month before he was hired by the de blasio administration the aide kevin o’brien had been fired from his previous job as a senior adviser at the democratic governors association in washington for similar reasons the association confirmed on monday mr o’brien had been a senior staff member for gov steve bullock of montana a centrist democrat who has been mentioned as a possible 2020 presidential candidate mr bullock served a one-year term as chairman of the governors association in 2015 and he sent mr o’brien to washington to be his representative at the organization when mr o’brien left the governors association in december 2015 mr bullock was among those who knew the reason a woman employed at the association had accused mr o’brien of sexually harassing her and an investigation had backed her up mr de blasio’s press secretary eric f phillips said on monday night that the mayor did not know of mr o’brien’s dismissal from the governors association he was made aware of the prior situation for the first time today as a result of your reporting mr phillips said mr phillips said that the department of investigation as part of a standard background check contacted both the governors association and an administrative office that deals with personnel for the state of montana he said that d.o.i received confirmation of title and work dates and no adverse information about mr o’brien’s employment as part of the process mr o’brien also filled out two questionnaires that included queries about previous employment there was no indication whether mr bullock had reached out to warn city hall officials about the harassment incident mr o’brien first went to work for mr bullock in montana in 2009 when mr bullock was attorney general according to a résum that mr o’brien submitted to officials in new york he was campaign manager during mr bullock’s successful run for governor in 2012 and became deputy chief of staff to the governor in 2013 mr o’brien’s appointment to the governors association was announced in february 2015 ten months later he was let go after the association substantiated the harassment claim against mr o’brien according to a governors association official familiar with the case when i was made aware of the complaint against mr o’brien at the democratic governors association i fully agreed with the decision to end his employment mr bullock said in a written statement provided to the new york times in an apparent reference to the subsequent harassment case in new york mr bullock added it’s clear that was not enough to protect these women from what has proven to be an unacceptable pattern of behavior on his part we all have a responsibility to do better and to put an end to sexual harassment and i’m committed to doing my part mr bullock said that he was deeply troubled to learn of the new york accusation when it was reported by the times earlier this month yet it was clear that mr bullock was aware that mr o’brien had gone on to work for mr de blasio and that they remained in contact according to mr de blasio’s schedule he met with mr bullock and mr o’brien at gracie mansion on oct 15 2017 after losing his post at the governors association it did not take mr o’brien long to land a new job to do so he relied on his friendship with a top democratic political strategist nicholas baldick who has worked closely with mr bullock and mr de blasio in a pair of emails on dec 8 2015 mr de blasio and mr baldick discussed offering a job to mr o’brien in city hall he may be available now mr de blasio wrote to mr baldick in an email with the subject line kevin o’brien pls discuss with me before you talk to him but my thought is we could slot him in as deputy chief of staff and see how he does thoughts mr baldick replied yes not sure for that position will hold off talking to him but he will likely call today an earlier email revealed that mr baldick founder of the consulting group hilltop public solutions had previously tried to help mr o’brien get a job in the de blasio administration shortly after mr de blasio took office in 2014 the emails were among thousands of pages of correspondence between the de blasio administration and a group of outside advisers that were made public after news organizations sued city hall to obtain the material when reached for comment on monday mr o’brien who is married and in his 30s issued a statement nearly identical to one that he released after the circumstances of his departure from city hall were disclosed blaming alcohol abuse for making horrible decisions there’s no excuse for what i’ve done i’m embarrassed and ashamed the statement read no one deserves to be treated that way i’ve apologized to the people i’ve hurt and will continue to do so because i am truly sorry mr o’brien started work at city hall as deputy chief of staff on jan 24 2016 with an annual salary of 175,000 according to city records he was promoted to acting chief of staff in early 2017 and his salary was increased to 220,652 he served in that capacity until the end of that year following mr de blasio’s re-election when he became a senior adviser to the mayor in announcing the change mr de blasio praised mr o’brien for doing an outstanding job in february 2018 two women accused mr o’brien of sexual harassment and he was forced to quit city hall although he remained on the payroll until late march city hall made no announcement about mr o’brien’s departure or the reason for it once again mr baldick came to mr o’brien’s rescue hiring him in april 2018 as a principal in hilltop’s new york office hilltop fired mr o’brien this month after the times reported about the sexual harassment case against mr o’brien at city hall mr baldick told the times on monday night that he had no idea that mr o’brien had been fired from the governors association because of a sexual harassment claim i was shocked and disappointed to learn about this side of kevin he said i never would have recommended him and i certainly wouldn’t have hired him to work at my firm mr de blasio said during a jan 17 news conference that he had not known until recently that mr o’brien had gone to work at hilltop he expressed surprise that hilltop had not contacted city hall to check mr o’brien’s references before giving him a job he defended the decision to allow mr o’brien to resign rather than firing him and to keep the reason for his exit secret saying that it was intended to protect the women who made the accusations against him the misconduct in this case literally makes me sick to my stomach mr de blasio said at the time had hilltop or any other prospective employer contacted city hall before hiring mr o’brien the mayor said the company would have been told that he resigned in lieu of termination which mr de blasio said would have served as a warning any employer who did a routine reference check would have been given a red flag sufficient to act on mr de blasio said at the news conference i would also say it is a rare employer who doesn’t do a reference check on an employee so i don’t think you should undercount that that red flag would have been perfectly abundantly clear in a separate statement mr bullock’s office said that no incidents of sexual harassment by mr o’brien were reported to the governor or his chiefs of staff during o’brien’s time of employment at the governor’s office or the attorney general’s office

2021-02-14T20:16:57.818Z - articleBody received: get the dealbook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines and the power-brokers who shape them the huge swings that defined stock trading in december have ended that doesn’t mean investors think everything is fine in the bond market traders of government debt are still signaling concerns about the direction of the united states economy among the clearest of these signs is the yield curve the yield curve essentially measures the difference between short-term and long-term government bonds when investors are expecting economic growth interest rates on long-term bonds like the 10-year treasury note are usually higher than those on short-term debt why because under normal circumstances it is riskier to lend money out for 10 years than for say three months a lot can happen over the next decade that might keep your loan from being repaid even by the government but when concerns about the economy mount that relationship can reverse investors tend to turn to long-term government bonds as a safe place to park money pushing down their yields while eschewing shorter-term government debt causing the rates on those securities to rise in the worst case when the rate on shorter-term bonds rises above that of longer-term ones the yield curve is said to have inverted and for the past 60 years when that has happened for a sustained period it has accurately predicted a recession we’re not there yet but the gap between the two rates has been moving steadily closer for two years as the federal reserve has raised short-term interest rates the trend accelerated late last year as investors began to worry about risks to the united states economy on jan 3 the gap between the three-month treasury bill and the 10-year note shrank to just 0.14 percentage points its narrowest level since september 2007 according to tradeweb it had stood at 0.89 percentage points at the start of november but a surprisingly strong jobs report on jan 4 and some soothing words from the fed chairman jerome h powell have taken some of the panic out of the stock market the s&p 500 is up 7.7 percent since jan 3 and has been notably more stable even in the face of bad news about global growth concerns in the bond market haven’t faded nearly as much however the spread between the 10-year note and three-month bills has widened since jan 3 but at about 0.34 percentage points on thursday is only back to where its was at the end of december what might explain the concerns well there’s still plenty of evidence that the global economy is slowing down just this week china reported its biggest monthly decline in exports in more than two years and germany said its economy had grown last year at its slowest rate since 2013 and of course there’s the government shutdown typically the effect of a shutdown on the economy is short-lived the longer the impasse goes on however the greater the chance that it can stall economic growth for now though the bond market is not signaling a recession it has not inverted for a sustained period and a flattening yield curve is not a consistent predictor of a coming recession only 20 percent of the time has the economy contracted in the 12 months after the spread between short-term and long-term government bonds narrowed to its current level according to data from james paulsen the chief investment strategist at the research firm leuthold group

2021-02-14T20:16:57.898Z - articleBody received: washington the leaders of unions representing air traffic controllers and aviation safety inspectors warned thursday that the partial government shutdown was hurting the safety of the nation’s air travel system another effort by the labor movement to press washington to put federal employees back to work without a fully functioning f.a.a a layer of safety is missing said mike perrone the national president of the professional aviation safety specialists which represents safety inspectors who are furloughed at a rally outside the capitol where a crowd of air traffic controllers and other aviation workers gathered on a blustery afternoon to call for an end to the shutdown mr perrone warned of the risk of sidelining f.a.a workers who could be inspecting planes and pilots there is no clear-cut evidence that air travelers have been put in danger so far because of staffing changes caused by the shutdown but the union leaders made the issue of safety a central part of their argument that the shutdown needed to end immediately every day that goes by that the government is shut down safety is going to be compromised mr perrone said every day that goes by something could occur that causes a crack in the system their show of concern on thursday was among the most visible efforts by public employee unions to try to highlight the consequences of the shutdown and urge president trump and congress to reopen the government at a rally outside the headquarters of the a.f.l.-c.i.o a short walk from the white house hundreds of people including federal workers and union leaders also gathered to demand an end to the shutdown they focused their blame on mr trump and republican lawmakers shame on the senate shame on the white house said richard l trumka the president of the federation this lockout has to end and it has to end now workers said they were facing urgent financial pressure i think from what i’ve saved up i can last six months said robert reynolds an aviation safety inspector who has been working for the federal aviation administration for 14 years it’s still going to hurt the effort by unions to build pressure on the president and lawmakers to end the shutdown complements one in the courts that is focused on employees who are working without pay last week the american federation of government employees filed a lawsuit claiming that the federal government was violating the fair labor standards act by not paying employees who were required to work during the shutdown another union representing federal workers the national treasury employees union filed a similar lawsuit this week the union has also filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the federal law that allows the government to require some employees to work without pay during a shutdown with its constitutional challenge the union is hoping to establish once and for all a principle that will stop these shutdowns from continuing to occur in the future said gregory o’duden its general counsel with some 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown there has been no shortage of stories of personal hardship brought on by the funding lapse those stories are certain to continue as federal workers go unpaid but the public display by the aviation unions on thursday highlighted a strategy of generating concern among ordinary citizens that fundamental government services are being put in jeopardy news reports about transportation security administration workers calling in sick during the shutdown have put a spotlight on one government service that if significantly disrupted would be immediately felt by the public the national transportation safety board has been unable to investigate a dozen transportation accidents because of the shutdown the accidents including several plane crashes with a small number of fatalities will be investigated after employees return from being furloughed according to the safety board the federal aviation administration is also among the agencies whose funding has lapsed as a result of the shutdown and the agency’s shutdown plan called for furloughs for about 18,000 of its 45,000 employees a long list of aviation trade groups and unions sent a letter to mr trump and congressional leaders on thursday that cataloged the different areas where the f.a.a had been hobbled this partial shutdown has already inflicted real damage to our nation’s aviation system the groups wrote and the impacts will only worsen over time the f.a.a workers who have been furloughed include about 3,000 aviation safety inspectors according to the professional aviation safety specialists their duties include performing oversight of commercial aircraft pilots and maintenance facilities as well as conducting in-flight and ramp inspections according to the union we can’t have the industry self-regulating mr perrone said this week in an interview he likened f.a.a inspectors to police officers parked on the side of a highway to deter drivers from speeding now we know the cops aren’t out there he said as a result he said instead of 55 i’m doing 65 and tomorrow maybe i’m doing 70 the union has urged its members to contact their congressional representatives to call for an end to the shutdown a phone script suggests that union members explain that our work is vital to the safety of the flying public and say that their status either furloughed or working unpaid is causing stress for me and my family inspectors are taking their case to airports too last week some picketed at miami international airport and one sign had a blunt message was your airplane properly inspected today the federal aviation administration does not know the inspectors union is planning pickets at other airports in the days to come air traffic controllers are working but not being paid and support staff has been furloughed according to the national air traffic controllers association the f.a.a.’s training academy in oklahoma city has been shut down leading to concerns about delays in bringing on new air traffic controllers when mr trump met wednesday with senate republicans senator james lankford of oklahoma cited the f.a.a as an example of how the shutdown was affecting federal workers a year from now when we’re short of air traffic controllers that will become a significant issue mr lankford said in an interview there will still be an impact from a shutdown this long the air traffic controllers association collected handwritten letters to deliver to lawmakers on capitol hill in an effort to inform them about how the shutdown is affecting air traffic controllers and their families the last thing they need to be worrying about is how they’re going to pay the bills jim marinitti a regional vice president for the union said this week in an interview they need to be concentrating on separating airplanes keeping the skies safe in a letter last week to congressional leaders the union’s president paul m rinaldi took issue with the absence of support staff we wouldn’t ask a surgeon to perform an operation without the assistance of a support team he wrote and we shouldn’t be asking air traffic controllers to continue working without support staff the f.a.a says travelers should not be worried inspectors who are furloughed are being called back to work as they are needed the agency says the traveling public can be assured that our nation’s airspace system is safe said greg martin a spokesman for the f.a.a we are allocating f.a.a resources based on risk assessment to meet all safety critical functions he added we continue to proactively conduct risk assessment and when we identify an issue we act and recall our inspectors and engineers as appropriate to address them

people coming to charleston south carolina they high-tail it down to florida or somewhere else offshore drilling might not captivate voters in most parts of the country but it did here for months mr cunningham called for the restoration of a federal ban as his republican opponent katie arrington talked about immigration and warned that a vote for him would be a vote for nancy pelosi’s san francisco values and in november mr cunningham 36 defeated ms arrington in a house district that last elected a democrat four years before he was born it was one of the biggest upsets of the midterms and it turned on an ideal issue for a candidate who before he became a lawyer was an ocean engineer we believe in science that line always drew applause he said in an interview i think it’s a sad state of affairs when you have to actually say that imagine someone saying that about any other subject like i believe in history topics that are proven with evidence and facts and numbers mr cunningham is one of at least 11 freshman representatives with a background in science medicine or technology eight of them are democrats and they are some of the first victors of a trend that began soon after president trump was elected alarmed by inaction on climate change and the administration’s marginalization of experts many more scientists have been entering politics there is this growing consensus among the scientific community that they need to go beyond advocacy and signing polite letters and actually get involved in electoral politics said shaughnessy naughton a chemist and the president of 314 action a two-year-old organization that supports candidates with scientific and medical backgrounds the group which raised 4 million for the 2018 elections trained about 1,500 prospective candidates and supported the eight winning democrats as well as senator jacky rosen and more than 30 successful state-level candidates while members of any party can attend trainings the group doesn’t endorse republicans for federal offices because ms naughton said we can’t justify supporting republicans when the g.o.p platform is aligned against scientific consensus on issues like climate change elaine luria an engineer who operated nuclear reactors in the navy flipped virginia’s second congressional district which had been represented by a republican for 16 of the last 20 years kim schrier a pediatrician won washington’s eighth district which had never elected a democrat sean casten a biochemist defeated a six-term republican incumbent in the sixth district of illinois t.j cox a chemical engineer won in california chrissy houlahan also an engineer in pennsylvania lauren underwood a registered nurse in illinois and jeff van drew a dentist in new jersey at least three republicans with science or medical backgrounds and starkly different views also won house seats mark green of tennessee a former army physician kevin hern of oklahoma a businessman with a degree in aerospace engineering and john joyce of pennsylvania a dermatologist in several of the districts that flipped science was at the very center of the campaign 314 action spent 500,000 on advertising in mr cunningham’s race hammering the offshore drilling issue and it was largely based on that issue that mr cunningham received endorsements from several local republican officials the same issue resonated in coastal virginia where ms luria said she did not meet a single person on the campaign trail regardless of political affiliation who wants offshore drilling off of our coast for mr casten a former cancer researcher with degrees in molecular biology biochemistry and biochemical engineering the big issue involved sterigenics a company that sterilizes medical equipment at a facility in willowbrook ill the plant uses a carcinogenic chemical called ethylene oxide and a department of health and human services report released in august found a high risk of cancer in nearby communities sterigenics said the report had purposefully relied upon a worst-case scenario for assessing risk the report became a liability for the incumbent republican peter roskam who had received campaign contributions from the american chemistry council the council and sterigenics had been lobbying the e.p.a for several years not to classify ethylene oxide as a known human carcinogen and mr roskam whose spokeswoman declined to make him available for an interview had supported legislation to put industry representatives on the e.p.a boards that make such decisions now that they are in washington the democratic scientists-turned-representatives face a new challenge many of them said that beyond addressing climate change and other science-related issues they wanted to bring a more scientific mind-set to congress for the last six years the house committee on science space and technology was led by lamar smith a texas republican with no scientific background under him the committee investigated the debunked idea that global warming had paused subpoenaed organizations whose research affirmed the reality of climate change and promoted rules that reduced the number of scientists and increased the number of industry representatives on e.p.a advisory panels at times committee members showed a basic lack of scientific knowledge during a hearing in 2014 steve stockman another texas republican said it was nonsensical to think melting glaciers and ice sheets would increase sea levels because glasses don’t overflow when the ice cubes in them melt mr smith has now retired and four other republicans on the committee were not re-elected the new chairwoman eddie bernice johnson a texas democrat and former psychiatric nurse is the first person with a scientific background to hold that position since the 1990s ms johnson said in an interview that she had invited the new scientists to join though committee assignments may not be finalized for several weeks but the old dynamics are not going to disappear there will continue to be tension even with some of the scientists on the other side of the aisle mr hern the aerospace engineer elected in oklahoma has questioned whether human activity is the primary cause of climate change and mr green the doctor from tennessee repeated the debunked claim that vaccines can cause autism he later backtracked telling huffpost that children should be vaccinated they too feel their experience gives them a more authoritative voice and in mr hern’s words an understanding of many of the issues that others might not have representative don beyer of virginia a democrat on the science committee acknowledged that eight people could not change the entire culture but he said they could change congress’s perspective so often our perspective of politicians is lawyers and people with the gift of gab mr beyer said now we’re getting people that have a deep knowledge of mathematics and physics and chemistry and biology and that’s a really important perspective in an increasingly scientific world mr cunningham is already preparing a bill that would ban drilling off the atlantic coast for 10 years mr beyer and bill foster an illinois democrat and physicist who is the only member of congress with a doctorate in a scientific field described several other legislative priorities for the committee including more oversight of the e.p.a and other science-related government bodies regulation of developing technologies like human genetic engineering artificial intelligence cryptocurrencies and mobile payments and of course measures to combat climate change one of the first may be carbon pricing legislation which would charge corporations for their carbon emissions because unlike more aggressive measures mr foster said he believed that might get through the republican-led senate mr foster said he believed mr casten would be particularly helpful on carbon pricing with experience in both biochemistry and business mr casten can really talk about the nuts and bolts about what it means he said and how different industry sectors will react to that and how that’s going to affect the carbon footprint of different industries in a quantitative way ultimately that sort of subject expertise more than the sisyphean task of changing the congressional approach to science may be the new members most immediate contribution while talking about ms luria a nuclear engineer mr foster recalled the congressional discussion of the iran nuclear agreement which included a page describing the technical changes iran needed to make to its reactor cores to ensure that the reactors could not produce large quantities of weapons-grade plutonium democrats and republicans were coming to me in this period saying bill what does this mean and how should i vote on it he said with elaine there at least that will cut my workload in half we’ll have two competent members who can talk about reactor cores

2021-02-14T20:18:57.472Z - articleBody received: atlanta jerome h powell the federal reserve chairman said friday that low inflation would allow the fed to be patient in deciding whether to continue raising interest rates a message welcomed by jittery investors the fed is confronting an increasingly uncertain economic outlook falling stock prices weakening global growth and concerns about president trump’s economic policies have set investors on edge and prompted warnings that the economic expansion is nearing its end but measures of domestic economic activity remain strong including friday’s report the economy added 312,000 jobs in december mr powell’s message on friday was that the fed can afford to watch and wait he said the best available evidence suggested that the economy was still in good shape but he also was at pains to reassure investors unsettled by his confident tone at his last news conference in mid-december he said that the fed was watching for evidence of weakness and that the health of the economy would ultimately determine the course of policy with the muted inflation readings that we’ve seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves mr powell said the fed predicted in december that it would raise rates twice in 2019 but mr powell said the central bank was ready to change course significantly if necessary the stock market driven down on thursday by concerns about growth surged on friday on the strength of the jobs data and then kept climbing as mr powell spoke investors who are worried about the growing economic impact of a trade war with china also hoped for progress toward a resolution when the trump administration and chinese officials hold meetings next week the s&p 500 rose 84.05 points to close at 2,531.94 the yield on the benchmark 10-year treasury rose 0.11 points to close at 2.668 percent read more the jobs data and signs of flexibility at the fed helped stocks soar on friday mr powell also defended the fed’s autonomy on friday in the face of sharp attacks by mr trump who has complained to aides that the fed’s rate increases would undermine economic growth and turn me into hoover a reference to the president during the great depression’s early years some of mr trump’s economic advisers alarmed by his inquiries as to whether he has the power to fire mr powell want to arrange a meeting between the two men mr powell under questioning by neil irwin an economics writer at the new york times said that he was open to meeting with mr trump as fed chairs have done with past presidents but that no meeting had been scheduled he also said the fed would make policy without regard to mr trump’s views i want the public to be assured that we have a strong culture it’s not a fragile one it’s not being disrupted he said asked if he would resign if mr trump asked him to do so mr powell replied directly no mr powell was joined onstage at the annual meeting of the american economic association by his immediate predecessors at the fed janet l yellen and ben s bernanke both of them criticized mr trump’s attacks as potentially damaging to the central bank and therefore to the economy strong economic growth fueled the fed’s decision to raise its benchmark rate four times in 2018 into a range from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent the rate which had hovered near zero in the wake of the financial crisis a decade earlier now sits at the lower end of the range that fed officials consider a reasonable estimate of neutrality meaning that the central bank is neither encouraging nor discouraging economic growth fed officials say the continued strength of the economy validates their management of monetary policy i think we’re actually in a good spot loretta mester president of the federal reserve bank of cleveland told cnbc on friday noting that job growth is strong and inflation is under control but critics including mr trump have said the economy still needs the fed’s help inflation remains below the 2 percent annual pace the fed regards as optimal suggesting that the economy has room to grow and workers are only beginning to reap the benefits of an expansion now in its 10th year clouds also are gathering on the economic horizon the trump administration increased economic growth last year through large tax cuts and increased federal spending but those benefits are waning and mr trump’s trade war with china is beginning to be felt by american companies like apple and fedex which have warned that the tit-for-tat tariffs are pinching profits the fed’s decision to raise the benchmark rate at its most recent meeting in mid-december drove down stock prices and bond yields in a show of concern about the prospects for continued economic growth asset prices imply an expectation that the fed will not raise interest rates at all during 2019 mr powell began his remarks by reiterating his view that the markets concerns are overstated he said that 2018 had been a good year for the united states economy and that the latest economic data suggested ongoing momentum heading into 2019 wall street’s pessimism he said is well ahead of the data but the fed chairman offered a different kind of relief to financial markets by emphasizing that the slow pace of inflation allows the fed to postpone judgments about the resilience of the economic expansion inflation was 1.8 percent during the 12 months that ended in november the most recent available data it is likely that inflation remained soft in december marking the seventh straight year that prices rose by less than 2 percent and inflation would have been even weaker but for the impact of mr trump’s tariffs according to a study published friday by the federal reserve bank of new york mr trump has repeatedly argued that the cost of the tariffs which are taxes on imported goods is being absorbed by chinese exporters but the study found that american consumers were paying a hefty price the authors estimated that the tariffs added about 0.3 percentage points to the consumer price index last year job growth has remained strong and wage growth has increased in recent months but mr powell said the fed was on guard against rising prices not rising wages he said the strength of the labor market does not raise concerns about too high inflation michael feroli chief united states economist at jpmorgan chase said mr powell’s remarks convinced him that the fed would move more slowly in 2019 mr feroli previously predicted three rate increases in 2019 he said he now expected the fed to raise rates twice in july and december powell’s message was unmistakable mr feroli wrote in a note to clients mr powell also sought to ease concerns in financial markets about the fed’s gradual reduction of its holdings of treasuries and mortgage bonds which it bought in large quantities during the financial crisis to help bolster the economy some analysts have argued that the fed’s retreat is exacerbating the current volatility in financial markets mr powell said that the fed disagreed but returning to his theme for the day that it was watching closely and willing to change its mind if we ever came to the conclusion that any aspect of our plans was somehow interfering with our attainment of our statutory goals we wouldn’t hesitate to change it he said

2021-02-14T20:18:57.646Z - articleBody received: scientists warned osteoporosis patients on thursday to avoid two common procedures used to shore up painful fractures in crumbling spines the treatments which involve injecting bone cement into broken vertebrae relieve pain no better than a placebo does according to an expert task force convened by the american society for bone and mineral research the task force noted that the pain goes away or diminishes within six weeks without the procedure patients should take painkillers instead the experts said and maybe try back braces and physical therapy patients also should take osteoporosis drugs to slow bone loss said dr peter ebeling head of the department of medicine at monash university in australia and lead author of the new report which was published in the journal of bone and mineral research a patient who has had a spine fracture and does not take the drugs has a one-in-five chance of developing another fracture in the next year with the medications the odds are one in 20 the new advice may not sit well with many doctors and patients for chronic pain caused by fractured vertebrae there are few good treatments and many patients believe the procedures eased their pain and increased their mobility that’s why people don’t want to let go of this said dr alan s hilibrand a professor of neurological surgery at jefferson university and a spokesman for the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons surgeons use two methods to deliver the bone cement in one operation vertebroplasty the cement is injected directly into the injured vertebra in a newer procedure kyphoplasty doctors inflate a balloon to elevate the broken bone into position and then inject the cement the treatments are widely advertised and promoted by companies that make surgical devices and bone cement as well as groups such as the national osteoporosis foundation insurers generally cover the treatments medicare pays about 2,400 to 3,000 for vertebroplasty and 6,500 to 10,000 for kyphoplasty depending on where the procedure is performed to assess the effectiveness of the two methods the task force reviewed previously published data vertebroplasty was tested in five rigorous trials with placebo controls the task force found subjects who received sham procedures reported just as much pain relief moreover for those who had the treatment pain relief did not last said dr bart clarke president of the a.s.b.m.r who wrote a perspective accompanying the task force report after a month pain among these patients was no less than it was among patients who did not have cement injections kyphoplasty has not been subjected to such rigorous evaluations but it has been compared with vertebroplasty in a few small trials in terms of pain relief the two procedures were roughly equivalent if one of these procedures is going to be offered the patient should be informed that there is a minimal chance it will help said dr ebeling who conducted one of the first randomized trials of vertebroplasty the natural history is that pain will get better over the next four to six weeks he added that’s what i tell my patients australia’s health care system stopped paying for the procedures in 2010 after two placebo-controlled trials failed to find a significant effect and their use dropped by about 70 percent dr ebeling said the problem for doctors and patients is that even if the pain diminishes with time patients may be desperate for relief in the short term the cement injections can seem to offer that suppose a patient is incapacitated by pain from a broken vertebra said dr joshua a hirsch a back-pain specialist at massachusetts general hospital is it so bad to offer bone cement you have a choice said dr hirsch opiates and lying in bed with diminished activity or a procedure that can mobilize patients and improve them then there are the difficult patients perhaps 10 percent of the total whose severe pain lingers for months dr hilibrand said he agrees with the task force’s findings but if patients still have recalcitrant pain one to three months after the fracture this is an option do you withhold treatment and have them continue to suffer dr david kallmes a radiologist at the mayo clinic and one of the first doctors to cast doubt on vertebroplasty said he understands the appeal i have seen miracles with vertebroplasty he said but the data are the data he tries to talk patients out of the treatment describing the risks which are small but real including bleeding infections leakage of the cement and new fractures from the procedures he explains the lack of benefit but if a patient insists he sometimes performs the procedure anyway if it’s not done by me it will get done by joe down the road he said

2021-02-14T20:18:57.713Z - articleBody received: phnom penh cambodia first came the 8,900-pound sticky-rice cake stuffed with mung beans and pork belly displayed at angkor wat and heralded as officially amazing by guinness world records then in rapid succession came a series of record-setting feats the largest-ever performance of madison dancing with 2,015 participants the world’s longest scarf 3,772 feet woven over the course of six months and paraded through the streets of phnom penh the cambodian capital and in november the world’s longest dragon boat 286 feet was launched into the mekong river and rowed by 179 oarsmen while this streak of oddball achievements might seem unconnected they are all part of prime minister hun sen’s push to get young people excited about his aging regime which he appears to consider essential to maintaining his grip on power the government’s intentions here are rather transparent they want to create images of visible enthusiasm for the nation and its leadership said katrin travouillon a scholar of cambodian politics at australian national university the initial salvo in this campaign was the rice-and-pork colossus unveiled at angkor wat in 2015 and touted as a modern-day marvel by the authoritarian mr hun sen now 66 and his son hun many 36 who hatched the idea as a showcase project for his new pro-government youth group crowds cheered as a representative from guinness world records certified that the rice cake would take its place in the record book alongside angkor wat the world’s largest religious structure and a source of enduring national pride i am proud to be a child of cambodia and today we have achieved a giant sticky-rice cake and the world will acknowledge that from now on mr hun many said in a triumphant speech at the event two-thirds of cambodia’s population is under 30 with no memory of the khmer rouge’s bloody rule in the 1970s or the long years of civil war that followed many are weary of their country’s international reputation for genocide and political dysfunction so the country’s youth are less susceptible to mr hun sen’s traditional message that his party’s leaders are national heroes deserving perpetual legitimacy because of the role they played helping to oust the khmer rouge from power in 1979 the point was driven home to mr hun sen in emphatic fashion in 2013 after a near loss to an insurgent political party in an election that year he has spent the past half-decade ramping up his efforts to appeal to the nation’s youth the c.p.p has to have recognized by now that a national identity forged on victimhood and gratitude is difficult to reconcile with the ideas and aspirations of the younger generation said ms travouillon referring to the ruling cambodian people’s party the new narrative emphasizes self-sufficiency and national pride with mr hun sen publicly thumbing his nose at the western donors who have poured billions of dollars of aid into the country a critical plank of this project has been a revival of the country’s youth corps headed by mr hun sen’s youngest and most affable son mr hun many officially it is nonpartisan in practice its activities support the ruling party at a gathering of the youth corps in november mr hun many urged participants to continue garnering world records kim sok a political commentator who fled the country last year after serving a jail term for criticizing the prime minister has spoken out against the flurry of record attempts he said in an interview from finland where he has been granted asylum that he could not understand why guinness would certify records obtained by agents of authoritarian governments they have people power and money and just order the people to spend the money to get a certificate from guinness world records and then use this as propaganda he said i think this certificate mocks the whole nation rachel gluck a spokeswoman for guinness world records said the organization made every effort possible to remain politically neutral and required applicants to meet our core values of integrity respect inclusiveness and passion mr hun many declined requests for an interview about his record-seeking quests but in a speech responding to criticisms of his giant cake scarf and boat as wasteful he defended the pursuit of records as crucial for promoting cambodian spirit at home and abroad what did we do it for he said it’s for our flag waving in the world and there is only one cambodian flag dr travouillon said the rhetoric surrounding these projects was revealing for its focus on unity and cooperation the giant scarf was heavily promoted in a media campaign targeting university students who were encouraged to try their hand at weaving a few strands in the name of national solidarity the sticky-rice cake was produced after months of divisive street protests and a parliamentary boycott over the results of the 2013 election at the cake’s unveiling mr hun many proclaimed it had been achieved only through a singular spirit his father then approached the gargantuan snack alongside sam rainsy the opposition leader who had run in 2013 on a change-oriented political platform that struck a chord with young people the men ceremonially cut the rice with a sword each took a bite and proclaimed a rapprochement but even epic cakes have their limits in bridging yawning political divides after a short period of collaboration mr hun sen began a series of lawsuits against mr sam rainsy that drove him from cambodia the prime minister later declared the entire opposition party illegal jailed many politicians and activists and without any real competition won the 2018 national election in a landslide mr kim sok the commentator said the sticky-rice cake and other monumental totems of power were depressing reminders of mr hun sen’s authoritarian reach they were also silly he added what is the innovation he asked of the rice cake it’s just making it bigger than normal do you think this is talent is it a great idea for the nation although older cambodians seemed skeptical several young people said the world records resonated with them i think it’s amazing said man nisa a soft-spoken 19-year-old who had ducked out of her university to pick up a new k-pop album she had ordered from a deliveryman on a motorbike i have never seen such achievements but the deliveryman yin hong 35 a migrant from the countryside disagreed i think it’s nonsense he exclaimed it’s a waste of money and doesn’t create jobs for anyone he added other countries don’t even make

2021-02-14T20:18:58.340Z - articleBody received: washington john r bolton found himself last weekend in a familiar but dangerous spot cleaning up after his boss announced the withdrawal of 2,000 troops from syria a decision that rattled allies and threw america’s middle east policy into turmoil but mr bolton is at least partly responsible for the conditions that led to president trump’s sudden move as the president’s national security adviser mr bolton has largely eliminated the internal policy debates that could have fleshed out the troop decision with timetables conditions and a counterterrorism strategy for after the troops leave under mr bolton’s management senior administration officials said the national security council staff had zero role in brokering a debate over america’s future in syria mr bolton officials said was surprised by the timing of mr trump’s announcement which contradicted his own pledge in september to keep american troops in syria faced with the president’s abrupt declaration which drew howls of protest from congress and concerned phone calls from allies like prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel mr bolton felt compelled to talk his boss into slowing down the process these officials said then mr bolton had to cobble together a withdrawal strategy that would normally have taken shape over weeks or months and laid the groundwork for mr trump’s decision not hastily followed it after mr bolton presented the details in israel on sunday mr trump pushed back on reports that he and his adviser were out of sync we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight isis and doing all else that is prudent and necessary he said in a tweet on monday firing at a report in the new york times rather than at mr bolton if mr trump did not repudiate his adviser the daylight between their words captured the tricky path that mr bolton 70 a former official in the george w bush administration who long occupied the hawkish fringe of the republican party has walked since entering the white house last april mr bolton himself famously battled with the bureaucracy in mr bush’s state department but the discordant messages laid bare a national security process that officials say has shrunk to little more than the instincts of an impulsive president there is not much mr bolton can do to temper his boss mr trump’s erratic style and habit of undermining his advisers has already driven out the secretaries of state and defense as well as mr bolton’s predecessor h r mcmaster mr mcmaster held many more meetings than mr bolton and was still routinely blindsided by mr trump’s tweets bolton is trying to salvage the situation but he’s unable to do so because everyone in the region will question whether he is speaking for himself or for the president said martin s indyk a former american ambassador to israel now at the council on foreign relations mr bolton officials said has put his energy into keeping the ear of the president his strategy has worked on some issues like withdrawing from the iran nuclear deal but less so on others like maintaining a presence in syria to counter iranian influence something mr bolton vowed to do only weeks before the president decided to pull out mr bolton was not the only official to urge mr trump to slow down on syria secretary of state mike pompeo made the same argument as did senator lindsey graham republican of south carolina and american military commanders who met with mr trump during his holiday visit to the troops in iraq mr netanyahu called mr trump to pass along the view that it is in israel’s interest for the united states to maintain a presence in the region according to an israeli official mr trump’s aides have created on the back end the process that you would normally have on the front end said derek h chollet a pentagon official under president barack obama in normal times mr chollet said you would have a discussion on a proposed decision that would lead to the decision and you would discuss how to implement one but now the process is such that once you get policy guidance from the president in the form of a tweet you reverse-engineer a process another example of this was north korea where mr trump decided to halt military exercises and informed the pentagon afterward defense department officials quietly continued the exercises but just did not refer to them as exercises white house officials said mr bolton came into his job determined to streamline the national security council which they said had become bloated during the obama administration with functions that often overlapped those of the agencies they insist his approach was welcomed during his first breakfast with defense secretary jim mattis one official said mr mattis asked mr bolton to hold fewer meetings but there is a long distance between standard-issue jokes about too many meetings and eliminating them completely pentagon officials said mr bolton did away with much of the process put in place by mr mcmaster a retired three-star army general who placed great emphasis on meetings where everyone got a say mr bolton’s preference one official said is to have one-on-one conversations with cabinet members or other senior officials directly rather than in a group or on a conference call he maintains more control of the process that way this person said patrick m shanahan the acting defense secretary has taken advantage of this channel according to another pentagon official he has not hesitated to call mr bolton directly something that mr mattis apparently did not do as much he tended to relay questions through his recently departed chief of staff kevin sweeney the national security council engaged in reverse engineering under mr mcmaster as well but officials said the trend had gotten worse under mr bolton in part because he did not trust the national-security bureaucracy and saw no reason to include it in policymaking mr bolton is also handicapped by not having a deputy who traditionally coordinates policy debates he has yet to replace mira ricardel an official who was forced out of the white house after she clashed with the first lady melania trump unlike in the past when the national security council was the president’s clearing ground for security policy one official said that the n.s.c under mr bolton was best described as another voice at a table crowded with advisers vying for influence with mr trump by all accounts mr bolton has a better relationship with the president than mr mcmaster did he also gets along with jared kushner mr trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser and with mr pompeo though officials said the secretary acted as a buzz saw toward some of his harder-edged ideas about iran mr bolton stumbled early in his tenure when he almost derailed a summit meeting between mr trump and the north korean leader kim jong-un by suggesting that libya would be a good model for nuclear disarmament talks with north korea the libyan leader muammar el-qaddafi was ousted and killed a decade after he agreed to give up his weapons with mr pompeo taking the lead on north korea mr bolton has carved out a sideline on issues relating to american sovereignty an issue he has championed for decades as a fixture in conservative foreign policy circles he spoke recently about the need to overhaul the nation’s foreign assistance programs and threatened judges on the international criminal court with sanctions if they investigated american troops in afghanistan that policy had not even fully cleared the review process when mr bolton announced it at the federalist society an n.s.c official said but he felt so confident that his views were in sync with mr trump’s that he went ahead and called the court ineffective unaccountable and indeed outright dangerous mr bolton sometimes gestures to a photo in his office that shows president george h.w bush huddling in the oval office with a small circle of national security aides as an example of the ideal way to manage foreign policy despite being a contemporary of mr trump’s however mr bolton is not a member of his inner circle he does not have the same relationship with mr trump that he had with mr bush sometimes with aides the president refers to him as mike bolton

2021-02-14T20:18:58.464Z - articleBody received: des moines allison kipp is all in for senator elizabeth warren’s presidential campaign but she was the exception ben miller a 21-year-old student at iowa state university said he wants to vote for an economic populist and if senator bernie sanders runs again it will be a tough choice between him and ms warren charles miller ben’s father said he expects to vote for ms warren but is also intrigued by a democrat who could be described as her ideological opposite michael bloomberg the former mayor of new york as democrats we haven’t seen a big field like this in a long time said the elder mr miller a 47-year-old resident of ankeny iowa and as long as they keep it positive as long as there’s no personal attacks and they just share their views it’s going to be a good thing i’m ready to be convinced such is the mood of iowa democrats who are currently feeling somewhat spoiled after a visit by ms warren this weekend more than a year before a single vote is cast in the state’s caucuses unofficially kicked off the 2020 democratic presidential primary the party’s 2016 primary was defined by rigid and bitter lanes of hillary clinton and mr sanders but as the 2020 nomination process begins the state’s voters are giddy at the prospect of a crowded field that could feature more than a dozen candidates across the ideological spectrum angry at wall street there’s ms warren the longtime critic of unrestrained markets and big corporations but also mr sanders or senator sherrod brown of ohio who are both mulling presidential runs those eager for a female candidate may be able to choose between senator kamala harris of california who is expected to announce a presidential campaign this month and other potential candidates including senators kirsten gillibrand of new york amy klobuchar of minnesota and elizabeth warren of massachusetts at least five of the expected major candidates will support liberal wish-list policies such as medicare for all there's no magic formula said allison kipp 39 who brought her daughter to a rally for ms warren in des moines on saturday you can't know what trump will do or say we need to find someone that inspires democrats transcript i’m launching an exploratory committee for president senator elizabeth warren could be fighting president trump for the keys to the white house in 2020 but the two already have a long history of trading barbs she is a goofus wannabe tyrant here’s how elizabeth warren has faced off against donald trump in the 2016 election warren gleefully played the role of attack dog for the democrats taunting trump on twitter and in speeches a small insecure money-grubber who doesn’t care who gets hurt so long as he makes a profit off it donald trump is worried about helping poor little wall street let me find the world’s smallest violin to play a sad sad song after trump went after a federal judge because of his hispanic heritage he’s a mexican we’re building a wall between here and mexico it was warren who went on the attack trump is picking on someone who is ethically bound not to defend himself exactly what you would expect from a thin-skinned racist bully and at the democratic national convention warren told liberals that trump had ripped off ordinary americans but he filed business bankruptcy six times always to protect his own money and stick the investors and contractors with the bill and for one low low price he’ll even throw in a goofy hat but it was her fight with trump over her claim of native american heritage that got the most attention and massachusetts is represented by pocahontas right pocahontas they call her pocahontas i’ve got more indian blood in me than pocahontas and i have none i mean sadly i have none but i have more than she does hi this is elizabeth warren trump’s unrelenting mockery prompted warren to release the results of a dna test that she says is proof of her ancestry the announcement largely backfired she apologized to the cherokee nation for taking the dna test my mother was born in eastern oklahoma but the feud between warren and trump continues president trump’s actions and instincts align with those of authoritarian regimes around the globe he embraces dictators of all stripes he cozies up to white nationalists he undermines the free press and incites violence against journalists as the 2020 presidential race heats up one thing is clear the skirmishes could get nastier the field of potential 2020 democratic nominees will be perhaps the most wide open since 1992 with no obvious front-runner to challenge president trump and no broadly unifying political ideology as it moves away from decades of dominance by the clintons and former president barack obama the result is a robust debate about the party’s direction which some voters believe is overdue iowa because of its first-in-the-nation presidential caucus has long played in outsized role in determining the outcomes of such political fights though other more diverse states have long complained of its influence voters in iowa take pride in being good adjudicators of political sensibilities iowans like ms kipp believe the democratic party must select the candidate with the boldest vision that energizes base voters regardless of political constraints gary himes 70 prefers a more incremental approach mr himes voted for mr trump in the 2016 general election after a lifetime as a democrat and said a candidate like former vice president joseph r biden jr can win over former democrats the party may have lost i wanted change mr himes said of his 2016 vote he has now pledged to support the democratic nominee in 2020 no matter who he or she is i went off track but now i'm back on he said joe biden’s allies say he sees himself as democrats best hope in 2020 throughout ms warren’s weekend tour of iowa the first for a declared major candidate residents and democratic primary voters said the prospect of a large field had already impacted their decision calculus instead of being deferential to a singular preferred candidate many listed a top tier considering they felt fondly about several members of the presumed field cassandra flomo 69 said she expects to use most of 2019 to hear out different candidates deciding even later in the process than usual ms flomo said she enjoyed ms warren’s des moines rally but also was intrigued by senator cory booker of new jersey ms flomo who supported mrs clinton said democrats were too nasty to each other in the 2016 presidential primary and that she hopes the large field will help damper tensions i don’t want any of that in-house fighting said ms flomo old people and young people they were too divided there just needs to be more inclusion i’m looking for a vibe said carolyn briggs a 63-year-old iowan who works at des moines area community college i need to be in the same room as someone and just look into their eyes there’s just some feeling you get she was attending ms warren’s des moines rally on saturday with her husband david who had wanted to watch the speech on television his wife said no in this state we’re political animals and we want to get to know the candidates she said we want them to come to our homes and into our schools only then you’ll know during stops in her five-city iowa tour ms warren laid several markers for the democratic candidates who will soon join her on the trail she repeatedly called for democrats to disavow corporate money and self-funding candidates a warning shot possibly aimed at mr bloomberg she also repeated several times that the country needs systemic and structural changes a pointed response to the democrats more focused on beating mr trump than laying out a personal framework i think that what our 2020 issue will be is how we talk about what we stand for ms warren said sunday in ankeny our affirmative vision of how we build a country that reflects our best values that’s what i try to talk about every chance i get i want to put on the table an idea and that is we need change and not just one statute here or one law there she said we need big structural change the ideas impressed ms briggs the iowan who told her husband they needed to see ms warren in person in a text message sent after the rally she said ms warren gave her the elusive vibe she seeks in quality presidential candidates she’s not pedantic she assumes her audience is intelligent and doesn’t speak down to him ms briggs said so far she’s my number one she added emphasizing so far

2021-02-14T20:18:58.551Z - articleBody received: good morning here’s the sign-up if you don’t already get california today by email yesterday we talked to austin beutner superintendent of the los angeles unified school district about the city’s teachers strike that has all but ground the operations of the nation’s second-largest school system to a halt today we hear from the other side my colleague jennifer medina talked to alex caputo-pearl the president of united teachers los angeles just before mayor eric garcetti announced that negotiations between the union and the district would resume today a meeting is scheduled for noon at city hall with the mayor’s staff serving as a mediator between the two groups mr caputo-pearl said that neither he mr beutner nor the mayor would be at the table for the negotiations we’re going to let our teams dig into it and then we’ll be involved soon enough he said late last night he did not make any predictions about when the strike would end we’re going to continue to strengthen our picket lines which have been growing with the support from our community and parents he added we’re going to pursue both tracks both picketing and bargaining at the same time the interview has been condensed and lightly edited jennifer medina how long do you expect the strike to last what would end it alex caputo-pearl in the bigger picture we need to see a real commitment to reinvesting in neighborhood public schools we need to see that there is willingness to substantially invest in that to use the 140 million from the governor we need to see that there is really reinvestment in class size reduction staffing issues counselors we want to see some regulation on the charter industry so that it does not just keep growing without limits we need to know they have some basic rules of engagement and accountability those are some of the key issues you’ve talked about making the picket lines even stronger to make the attention to los angeles public schools really make a difference what do you want the wider public particularly those without a connection to the schools here to understand the vast vast majority of our members have been out in the rain every day they’ve been joined by tens of thousands of parents we’ve had two major demonstrations downtown with thousands of people and l.m.u released a poll last night that showed almost everyone in the county supports the teachers strike so this is clearly touching a nerve and the reason for that is because our public schools and students have been neglected and starved for a very long time and the reason they’ve been neglected is because the resources are going to privatized charters this is an opportunity to highlight that california has one of the most permissive systems for charters it wasn’t supposed to create an industry it was supposed to create experiments to feed back into the system it’s also a time to reiterate that it’s criminal that in california we do not do enough to take care of public schools this has the potential to be a real watershed moment challenging leaders rather than letting it slide off the cliff what role do you see for mayor garcetti here when we spoke to mr beutner he suggested that the city might devote some of its funding for homeless children to support schools do you see that happening i think there are certainly things that the city can do and mayor garcetti has been fulfilling some of that over the last few years but all of us including him think that more can be done a note we often link to content on sites that limit access for

2021-02-14T20:20:30.812Z - articleBody received: in the days after jazmine barnes 7 was fatally shot inside a moving car near a walmart outside houston on sunday morning the police have released just one concrete clue about her killer an image of a red pickup truck recorded by a surveillance camera near the scene of the shooting the authorities believe that the gunman described as a man in his 30s or 40s with a beard and wearing a hooded sweatshirt was driving the truck the harris county sheriff’s office believes the gunman fired at random into the car in which jazmine was riding with her mother and three sisters a 6-year-old and two teenagers a bullet struck jazmine in the head her mother said the police said wednesday that they still had not identified the gunman but the case has drawn the attention of national civil rights activists and fueled speculation that the shooting was racially motivated the gunman is white the police said and jazmine was black at a news conference on wednesday afternoon harris county sheriff ed gonzalez said officers were pursuing a number of tips they had received and taking a fresh look at a similar and still unsolved shooting that took place nearby in 2017 the department was also increasing patrols amid concerns that the gunman could strike again we’re not going to stop until we solve this case sheriff gonzalez said jazmine’s mother laporsha washington and her sisters met with harris county investigators on wednesday morning to help them create a composite sketch of the gunman said lee merritt a lawyer for the family the sheriff’s office released that sketch on thursday in another effort to garner the public’s help mr merritt and shaun king a prominent racial justice activist and a columnist at the intercept have offered a 100,000 reward for information leading to the gunman’s arrest the amount raised was a combination of their own money according to a spokeswoman for mr merritt and donations they had received on thursday deandre hopkins a wide receiver on the houston texans said that he would donate his paycheck from the team’s playoff game this weekend to help pay for jazmine’s funeral mr hopkins will receive 29,000 for the game which is determined by the n.f.l.’s current collective bargaining agreement when i see jazmine barnes face i see my own daughter mr hopkins wrote on twitter since the reward was announced mr merritt said he had received several tips from people who said they had seen the same red pickup truck in the area before jazmine was killed one person reported seeing a man in a red pickup truck break into a parked car and steal a gun mr merritt said he said he had forwarded those tips to detectives at the harris county sheriff’s office we are getting a lot of tips now mr merritt said in an interview the word is out there sheriff gonzalez said he could not confirm details of the tips the police were investigating but he added that the department appreciated the public’s help and would methodically vet all of the information it was receiving besides those possible leads mr merritt said there might be a connection between jazmine’s killing and the shooting of two people nearby a year and a half earlier on aug 30 2017 a white man in a pickup truck opened fire with an ar-15-style rifle at a car carrying a’vonta williams and his then-girlfriend’s family according to the sheriff’s office and mr williams’s mother no one was killed but a bullet traveled through mr williams’s legs shattering both of them his mother kisshima williams said in an interview on wednesday another bullet was lodged in the stomach of his then-girlfriend’s grandmother after the sheriff’s office faced criticism for not aggressively investigating the shooting which occurred in the chaotic days after hurricane harvey made landfall the authorities announced a renewed effort to identify the gunman but no one has been arrested sheriff gonzalez said that investigators were looking into the 2017 case once again to see if we may have missed anything he added that the previous shooting occurred about six miles from the site of the more recent attack though the victim eventually drove to the area where the more recent one took place ms williams said that another son read about jazmine’s killing on sunday and immediately called her to point out the similarities between the two cases it has to be the same person ms williams said it’s too similar she said that a’vonta who is now 22 did not want to talk about the shooting but that he also believed the cases were connected i talked to him last night and it’s rough for him because he’s a young man she said my son was bedridden for four months

2021-02-14T20:20:30.979Z - articleBody received: san francisco a common belief among tech industry insiders is that silicon valley has dominated the internet because much of the worldwide network was designed and built by americans now a growing number of those insiders are worried that proposed export restrictions could short-circuit the pre-eminence of american companies in the next big thing to hit their industry artificial intelligence in november the commerce department released a list of technologies including artificial intelligence that are under consideration for new export rules because of their importance to national security technology experts worry that blocking the export of a.i to other countries or tying it up in red tape will help a.i industries flourish in those nations china in particular and compete with american companies the number of cases where exports can be sufficiently controlled are very very very small and the chance of making an error is quite large said jack clark head of policy at openai an artificial intelligence lab in san francisco if this goes wrong it could do real damage to the a.i community the export controls are being considered as the united states and china engage in a trade war the trump administration has been critical of the way china negotiates deals with american companies often requiring the transfer of technology to chinese partners as the cost of doing business in the country and federal officials are making an aggressive argument that china has stolen american technology through hacking and industrial espionage tech companies academics and policymakers are calling on the commerce department to take a light hand with a.i export rules ahead of a jan 10 deadline for public comment their argument has three main points restrictions could harm companies in the united states and help international competitors they could stifle technology improvements and they may not make much of a difference in august congress passed the export controls act of 2018 which added export restrictions to emerging and foundational technologies in mid-november the commerce department tasked with overseeing the restrictions published a list of technologies for consideration including several categories of a.i like computer vision speech recognition and natural language understanding the restrictions would affect the export of technology to certain countries though it does not specify which ones the commerce department proposal points to countries that have faced trade and arms embargoes in the past those include china russia and iran the commerce department declined to comment on the proposed restrictions after taking public comments the department will draft a formal plan it could result in anything from new licensing rules for a.i exports to outright bans artificial intelligence could be as vital to the tech industry as the world wide web was 25 years ago it is easy to forget that before the mid-1990s the tech industry in the united states was in a slump and the consumer electronics giants of japan looked unbeatable that changed as silicon valley companies popularized innovations like the web browser and e-commerce today the likes of google apple and facebook dominate tech all over the world but american dominion in artificial intelligence is far from guaranteed china is investing billions in a.i for both commercial and military use and the expertise that has flooded to silicon valley over the years is starting to stay home partly because of immigration restrictions centers for a.i research are popping up all over the world from toronto to cambridge england and beijing enforcing export controls on artificial intelligence would present an unusual challenge for regulators a.i is something policymakers call a dual-use technology it has innocuous commercial applications like helping to steer your car or ask your phone a question it also has important military uses like helping a weaponized drone find its targets defense planners believe a.i represents the next notable change in military weapons akin to the tactical targeting of so-called smart bombs a generation ago or nuclear weapons before that a.i can also aid surveillance systems and even disinformation campaigns through software that can produce fake photos and videos but trying to draw a line between what is military and what is commercial is exceedingly difficult said r david edelman a technology policy researcher at the massachusetts institute of technology it may be impossible it is difficult to put a made in america label on artificial intelligence research on the technology is often done collaboratively by scientists and engineers all over the world companies rarely hold on to the details of their a.i work as if it were a secret recipe instead they share what they learn in hopes that other researchers can build on it one company’s breakthrough is often the latest iteration of what many researchers at private companies and universities have been working on a lot of the computer code for a.i is published on sites like arxiv.org a repository of academic and corporate research so many policy experts believe that if the united states restricts the export of a.i products and services it will have little effect on the progress of a.i in china and other countries the core of these technologies is international and freely available said mr edelman who was a special assistant for economic and technology policy under president barack obama no country the u.s or china has a monopoly on that federal regulations exempt publicly available information from export control that means that the government is unlikely to bar companies and universities from publishing fundamental a.i research but it could establish controls that restrict foreign access to that information said greg jaeger a lawyer at the law firm stroock stroock lavan who deals with export controls the commerce department could also restrict the export of cloud-computing technology and computer chips related to artificial intelligence the export restrictions memo mentions both amazon and microsoft already operate cloud computing businesses in china through local partners and google has long hoped to do the same thing amazon google and microsoft declined to comment overly restrictive rules that prevent foreign nationals from working on certain technologies in the united states could also push researchers and companies into other countries it might be easier for people to just do this stuff in europe said jason waite a lawyer with the firm alston bird who specializes in international trade

2021-02-14T20:20:31.141Z - articleBody received: paris what to do about islam in france considering islamist terrorist attacks communalism and the international manipulation of muslim communities the matter is pressing but it’s contentious because managing islam seems to go against laïcit france’s staunch version of state secularism and a 1905 law that mandates the separation of church and state wouldn’t revising that law be an admission that secularism is bowing to islamism on the other hand if the law isn’t revised or if the french state cannot find other ways of monitoring and steering islam then islam in france risks falling under the control of foreign states or the influence of radicals that is already the case actually since laïcit prohibits the french authorities from using public funds to build mosques or train imams algeria morocco turkey and saudi arabia have stepped in according to the newsmagazine l’express 70 percent of imams practicing in france are not french in an attempt to overcome these paradoxes president emmanuel macron recently convened at the lysée palace the country’s various muslim leaders and then representatives from all religions the order of the day for the broader meeting held on jan 10 was old emergencies how to punish radicalism control the financing of mosques and make muslim authorities accountable the news daily le monde which obtained the note that the president handed to attendees reported that the government was proposing to revise the 1905 law while confirming its principles it was an attempt to square a circle a malaise so very french and the narrower question of what to do about imams their origins their trainings their salaries summarizes it well here is a first hurdle it’s virtually impossible to tally imams in france no one really knows how many there are partly because the collection of data based on ethnic or religious grounds is prohibited the last available estimates from the interior ministry which date back to 2012 put the number of mosques in france at around 2,500 a 2016 report by the senate said it was closer to 3,000 but those figures are as outdated today as they were imprecise in the first place what even counts as a mosque when so many muslim believers gather in the basements of low-income building complexes or other improvised prayer halls and there being 2,500 mosques doesn’t mean there are 2,500 imams in sunni islam the version of islam most prevalent in france anyone can declare oneself an imam and volunteer to lead prayers or the friday sermon there is no central authority overseeing islam in france anyway how do you supervise the mosques you don’t fund or imams you can’t pay for the time being france for lack of its own theological schools has favored filtered immigration it brings in imams from abroad mostly from the home countries of its main immigrant communities either for long stretches or just for ramadan paradoxically one of the justifications for this policy though rarely admittedly publicly is security it seems less risky to rely on an official imam from algeria than to let a self-proclaimed imam emerge in a paris banlieue or suburb for example algerian imams wishing to go to france must first undergo investigations and as the algerian government puts it modestly the algerian expertise in internal security matters ensures quality vetting the government has also offered its services to the united states belgium and italy in 2018 algeria sent approximately 100 imams to officiate in france morocco and tunisia contributed about as many each in 2017 l’express ran the headline morocco the factory of french imams with an article on imam-apprentices some sent from france whom the kingdom was training in how to dispense middle-ground islam before dispatching them abroad according to the news weekly le point turkish consular structures oversee more than 250 mosques and about 200 official imams seconded by turkey to france the filtered import of foreign imams may look like a good practical solution in fact it’s an ideological trap these imams even if acting in good faith can only reinforce communalism in france and work against integration because they are not french in the name of laïcit france is dangerously delegating its islam to other states those states benefit for the algerian government the export of imams seems to confirm the country’s return to stability saudi arabia sees proselytizing as a form of soft power so does turkey which appears invested in maintaining a religious lobby abroad the stakes are high apparently when last year the austrian government expelled about 60 turkish preachers to counter it said the creation of parallel societies and political islam turkey called the move racist and islamophobic when the french government said it wanted to create a distinct islam of france algeria speaking indirectly via an expert’s op-ed in state media accused it of arrogance tinted with ignorance the import of imams the foreign financing of mosques these delegations of power by the french authorities are a dead end they won’t do enough to stem radicalism in france and they will do even less to nurture the emergence of precisely an islam of france the president’s office seems to want to overcome all this but some of the participants in that first meeting convened by mr macron at the beginning of the year reacted with calculated anger before accepting the invitation members of the french council of the muslim faith decried the colonial administration of islam it’s a clever conflation by invoking colonialism they can leverage guilt as a bargaining chip while maintaining islam’s communal valence why do that for fear of losing power if france develops a sui generis form of islam harping on muslims status as a once-colonized group is a way of highlighting their ties to their countries of origin over those to their host country past attempts to create muslim councils the great mosque of paris the federation of french muslims the union of islamic organizations in france also known as muslims of france that could effectively represent france’s various muslim communities have failed one reason is the rivalry among the groups leaders different confessional strands and foreign governments with ties to immigrant communities algeria competes with morocco and both of them compete with turkey and saudi arabia as the journalist henri tincq has pointed out on slate.fr the paris mosque is loyal to algeria the federation of french muslims has ties to the muslim world league and morocco and the union of islamic organizations in france is close to the muslim brotherhood it’s difficult to separate islam from its community and the community from its country of origin without being accused of interference whenever the french government tries to manage islam in france algeria says it’s meddling when in saying so it is algeria that is meddling in france’s affairs so what can be done one solution has been put forward by hakim el karoui an international consultant close to mr macron and the author of the recent report the islamist factory and in 2016 of a french islam is possible first he recommends strictly supervising external financing or informal funds collected in mosques neighborhoods or local associations he also suggests creating an independent fund for training imams by taxing halal businesses money collected through the muslim alms known as zakat and commerce around the pilgrimage to mecca those are good ideas for trying to keep state and church or cult separate while integrating french muslims into france but just what should be uniting is proving divisive mr el karoui’s proposals are controversial notably for the french council of the muslim faith one of the organization’s vice-presidents called them an insult to islam and accused mr el karoui of conflating islam and islamism that reaction sums up well the endless-seeming debate between those who want to maintain a monopoly over islam in france and those who wish to develop an islam of france kamel daoud is a contributing opinion writer and the author of chroniques selected columns

which have long been dogged by allegations of corruption and physical abuse but few victims spoke out that changed this month when shim suk-hee 21 a member of south korea’s national short-track speedskating team and a two-time olympic gold medalist said she had been repeatedly raped by her former coach cho jae-beom since she was 17 mr cho 38 was fired as national team coach shortly before the start of the winter olympics in pyeongchang south korea last year on allegations of violent abuse against athletes in september he was sentenced to 10 months in prison for physically assaulting four athletes including ms shim between 2011 and the preparations for the pyeongchang games if ms shim’s accusation of sexual assault is corroborated it would add more weight to the long-held allegation among sports analysts that south korea’s glory in short-track speedskating has been built on a brutal training regimen that included beatings and other forms of violence allegations of abuse against elite athletes are being addressed in other countries including the united states where lawrence g nassar a former doctor for the women’s national gymnastics team was sentenced last year to decades in prison after being convicted of sexually assaulting numerous young women mr cho speaking through his lawyers denied raping ms shim the police said that they had confiscated his cellphone and computers to look for criminal evidence ms shim’s accusations against her former coach have sent shock waves through the country’s sports community south korea is particularly proud of its short-track speedskating the country has won 24 olympic gold medals more than any other country since the sport became part of the games in 1992 ms shim herself has won more than 20 gold medals in international competitions since 2012 including a gold in the 3,000-meter team relay at the 2014 winter olympics she won the same medal in pyeongchang this unveils the humiliating underside of our country’s glorious facade as a sports powerhouse president moon jae-in said on monday mr moon called for a thorough investigation urging his government to help other victims feel safe enough to speak out his remarks came as more than 260,000 people signed a petition to his office demanding a longer prison term for mr cho mr moon’s government was caught off guard by ms shim’s allegations only hours before ms shim’s accusations were first reported in the local news media last tuesday the country’s korean sport and olympic committee reported making strong progress in its campaign to protect athletes against sexual and other types of abuse in a survey of 1,201 athletes including all 791 national team members the committee said it had found only four cases of sexual violence in a similar survey in 2010 almost 27 percent of respondents reported sexual abuse the government said it would open a more comprehensive investigation of sexual crimes in the sports community vowing to expel perpetrators from the field permanently and to take steps to prevent schools and other teams from hiring them one of the problems has been that the perpetrators were not properly punished and they often returned to their old jobs vice sport minister roh tae-kang said last week encouraged by ms shim’s accusations a former judo competitor shin yoo-yong 24 publicly accused her former coach of having repeatedly raped her since she was a high school student her coach once tried to silence her with a 445 payoff after his wife began suspecting him of having a sexual relationship with her ms shin said in a facebook post and in an interview with the hankyoreh newspaper published on monday the police said they were investigating the case solidarity for young skaters a group of current and former ice skaters and coaches said at least two other victims planned to speak in public other victims of sexual violence were afraid to speak out because whistle-blowers in the past had been vilified and ostracized in their profession which is ruled by a rigid hierarchical relationship between coaches and athletes said the group’s leader yeo jun-hyung a former national team coach the government’s efforts to encourage whistle-blowers by opening hotlines for victims have not worked critics said if shim suk-hee were not an olympic gold medalist her case too could have been buried chung yong-chul a professor of sports psychology at sogang university in seoul the south korean capital said at a news conference last week sports experts had long said that abuse was widespread in south korea where winning olympic golds justified physical assaults in south korea athletes often live together in dormitories and routinely skip other classes leaving them with few other career choices such a system gives coaches exceptional power over athletes sports commentators say mr cho who had coached ms shim since she was in primary school regularly inspected her cellphone to see whom she was talking to her lawyer lim sang-hyuk told reporters when she was in the fourth grade mr cho broke a bone in her finger with a hockey stick mr lim said ms shim could not protest this behavior because of fears that mr cho would end her career mr lim said the coach once tinkered with ms shim’s skate blades in a competition to favor other athletes mr lim added ms shim’s troubles first came to public attention last january when she left the national team training facility in the run-up to the pyeongchang games because of physical abuse mr cho was quickly removed as coach after an investigation he was briefly hired to coach the chinese national team after he was banned from working in south korea but he later returned home to face trial testifying at mr cho’s appeals trial last month ms shim said mr cho used to punch and kick her until she felt she might die during training for the pyeongchang games ms shim claimed that a fall she had during a pyeongchang competition was because of a concussion she had suffered at mr cho’s hands i came here so that there will be no more victims like me ms shim said

night president trump relied on tired stories of immigrant violence that he has often repeated backed by statistics of dubious validity and delivered in his typically nonemotive style mr trump’s advisers thought this speech would move the nation and cause a dramatic shift in public sentiment to support the wall or take the onus of the government shutdown off him they were wrong arguably the speech is simply a sign of his desperation the man is consumed by an obsessive need to fulfill a campaign pledge punch line he seems to believe that to abandon the wall might risk losing some of his core base the same group whose good will he may need to help him overcome a future impeachment challenge mr president as you have done so many times in your two years as president your speech further debased the dignity of the office in the past oval office speeches have been reserved for true national crises not those manufactured to serve a president’s own political self-interest as if we really need any more evidence mr trump once again underscored that he is unfit to occupy the white house ken derowswarthmore pa to the editor much of president trump’s oval office address focused on the crimes committed by illegal immigrants we need to remember that wherever you have people you have sin even our outstanding military has a small percentage of personnel who commit crimes while serving overseas i hope that no one would argue that because of this minuscule minority the military should be forbidden from serving overseas therefore we should be equally sensitive when talking about illegal immigrants it is wrong to tarnish all because of the crimes of a very small minority rev ian s markhamalexandria va.the writer is the dean and president of virginia theological seminary to the

to the editor in president trump’s address to the nation he stated that migrant children are being used as human pawns by vicious gangs and that is exactly what mr trump is doing to federal workers who are receiving no pay during the government shutdown joann lee frankclearwater fla to the editor i wonder if president trump has thought of starting his own gofundme page for his wall as some of his supporters have done it might save face for him it would show him who his supporters really are and we could reopen the government ganka brownlaguna beach calif to the editor president trump has never addressed the nation with such fervor concerning gun control following any of the mass shootings by americans it appears that as far as he is concerned thoughts and prayers are enough for those who have lost loved ones to domestic killers only those killed by illegal immigrants are worth such public presidential concern james quinnlilburn ga to the editor re trump suggests declaring national emergency to skirt congress on wall news article jan 5 do we have a national emergency you bet do we need to fix a broken immigration system sure and there is bipartisan support to do so is the broken immigration system the national emergency no the national emergency is that president trump has shut down the federal government causing significant and in some cases irreparable harm to federal workers private industry that supports the government and our national parks the national emergency also includes that our system of checks and balances can be upset by one man senator mitch mcconnell refusing to let congress do its job the framers of the constitution never saw this coming they must be spinning in their graves barry luriebala cynwyd pa to the editor one problem with wall negotiations is they don’t have the right people in the room they need rush limbaugh ann coulter and fox news these are the real parties that can give president trump permission to accept a house democratic offer to end the government shutdown they need to give the president reassurance that he won’t be scolded and punished by far-right conservative media mark bradydix hills n.y

2021-02-14T20:20:54.841Z - articleBody received: baltimore the baltimore ravens startling charge into the playoffs was spurred by something perhaps even more surprising a radical run-first style of offense led by the rookie quarterback lamar jackson baltimore’s unconventional style of attack in the midst of a pass-happy n.f.l era rescued the ravens who won six of their final seven regular-season games and the most impressive victory in that stretch was a 12-point romp over the chargers in los angeles in week 16 in the end however the defeat of the chargers was the ravens undoing in their rematch here sunday in an a.f.c wild-card playoff game in the week leading up to sunday’s contest the chargers dissected the videotape of the ravens dec 22 triumph in los angeles until every play and more important the alignments before every play were committed to memory the chargers defensive coaches schooled the players on every ravens tendency and tried a daring lineup that included seven defensive backs instead of the usual four or five the study and the strategy worked until a late rally in the final minutes baltimore’s new-look offense had just 3 points and three first downs jackson was challenged and confounded into a dreadful performance as los angeles built a commanding lead and held on to upset the ravens 23-17 we had better reads on their formations and we saw things coming chargers defensive end joey bosa said in the winning locker room it really was kind of a blessing to have played them and seen them just a few weeks ago the chargers defensive approach forced jackson into three fumbles one of which he lost and an interception he was sacked seven times you could see we were frustrating them los angeles cornerback casey hayward jr said they were confused what had been working for them was not working or as chargers coach anthony lynn said when asked if the ravens had appeared flustered if you’re used to running the ball for 300 yards and you get only 80 yeah you get flustered los angeles which has won its last seven road games will travel to new england to face the patriots in a divisional-round game sunday at 1 p.m for the chargers the rare alignment of seven defensive backs which replaced bulky linebackers with smaller fleet defenders was a risk but it was intended to thwart jackson’s advanced rushing skills lamar is so fast we wanted our fastest guys defending him even if it meant smaller guys lynn said we didn’t know if it would work but we wanted to take a look at it we were definitely ready to move onto a different defensive grouping if it didn’t work but it did indeed it was effective immediately and set the tone for the game on the first play from scrimmage jackson kept the football and tried to dash around right end he was tackled for a 1-yard loss by safety derwin james recalling the play lynn smiled broadly the first time we played them we played their game he said today we played our game for the ravens the loss brought a sudden end to a season marked by drastic change the longtime ravens quarterback joe flacco was overtaken by jackson who remains the franchise’s top quarterback moving forward john harbaugh whose job as baltimore’s head coach had seemed in jeopardy until the late surge by the ravens still may not remain flacco did not comment on his future sunday although he insisted that he did not think he should have replaced jackson as the ravens fell behind los angeles by 17 points harbaugh also declined to discuss his own future in detail no one can say what tomorrow is going to bring harbaugh said we’ll see i have every expectation to be here as long as they want me here the victory was also a subtle but authoritative accomplishment by the veteran chargers quarterback philip rivers who was appearing in his 10th postseason game rivers who completed 22 of 32 passes coolly and carefully led the los angeles offense on six scoring drives against the n.f.l.’s top-ranked defense rivers did not throw an interception and was sacked just once and while the chargers lost one fumble they were otherwise judicious with the football and exhibited the kind of ball-control offense that had been baltimore’s bread and butter in its charge to the playoffs advancing cautiously for most of the game los angeles kicked four field goals to take a 12-0 halftime lead in the third quarter a chargers turnover and a blocked punt by the ravens gave baltimore a brief surge of momentum but the ravens could turn the miscues into only 3 points when a fumble recovery by c j mosley led to a 33-yard justin tucker field goal after the ravens buck allen partially blocked a punt and gave baltimore good field position the possession led only to a 50-yard field-goal attempt that tucker missed on the ensuing chargers possession a 28-yard pass from rivers to mike williams followed by a 14-yard run by melvin gordon set up a third down from the ravens 1-yard line gordon was tripped and fell just before the goal line the play was ruled a touchdown until it was overturned by video replay on the subsequent fourth-down play gordon bulled into the end zone the chargers completed a 2-point conversion to extend their lead to 20-3 at this point fans at m&t bank stadium began chanting flacco’s name jackson remained in the game but his presence elicited a chorus of boos from the crowd that displeasure intensified when jackson was twice sacked on a three-and-out series but on the next series jackson awakened and tossed a 31-yard touchdown pass to michael crabtree with 6 minutes 33 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter on the ravens next possession jackson connected with crabtree again throwing a 7-yard touchdown pass that cut the chargers lead to 23-17 with 1:59 left the ravens did get the football for a final series but their comeback ended when jackson was stripped of the football as he was preparing to pass the fumble was recovered by the chargers melvin ingram who dominated the ravens offensive line throughout sunday’s game ingram had seven tackles and two sacks this was and was not a typical game for us rivers said afterward because we’ve had all kinds of victories ugly ones pretty ones good games offensively and good games defensively that’s just us but mostly i think we’re a pretty good team

2021-02-14T20:20:55.009Z - articleBody received: scientists quickly condemned the chinese researcher who altered the dna of at least two embryos to create the world’s first genetically edited babies defying a broad consensus against hereditary tinkering but as the times reported last week the global scientific community is divided over what to do next should researchers agree to a moratorium on any human genome editing that can be passed down to future generations or should they simply tighten existing criteria it’s good that the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine are planning a global forum to address these questions but it will be crucial for biologists to seek substantial input from policymakers ethicists social scientists and others crispr the gene editing technique that the chinese scientist he jiankui used has enabled scientists to alter human dna with far greater ease than ever before it has the potential to remake life as we know it by preventing devastating diseases among many other possibilities and decisions about its future use should be driven by as inclusive and global a dialogue as possible fortunately there are several ways to broaden the conversation diversify the deciders science is a noble endeavor but it is not entirely pure patents and profits and the race against competitors influence individual researchers as well as entire scientific programs the crispr patent which is currently the subject of a fierce legal battle is expected to be worth 1 billion at least those influences are not necessarily corrupting but money and ego have a way of skewing priorities dr he for example is said to have gone rogue partly out of a desire to be the first to create crispr babies as gene-editing technology advances toward the clinic scientists will need to do more than listen to the concerns of bioethicists legal scholars and social scientists they will have to let these other voices help set priorities decide what questions and issues need to be resolved before theory becomes practice that may mean allowing questions over societal risks and benefits to trump ones about scientific feasibility as several scholars have suggested a global observatory an international consortium of experts from many different fields in many different countries would go a long way toward making this shift engage the public obvious though this may sound it’s not a given there’s a lot of skepticism about the value of public involvement in science and technology decisions says simon burall a senior associate with involve a british nonprofit dedicated to increasing public engagement in science that’s too bad there’s plenty of evidence that having citizens weigh in on proposed policies makes them better and more sustainable there are also far too many examples of the converse leaving the public out of the conversation invites suspicion and mistrust that can be difficult to overcome it’s easy to dismiss concerns over new technology as the product of ignorance it’s also a mistake surveys show that most people already support genome editing as long as it’s directed at intractable diseases and not at the creation of genetically enhanced designer babies scientists and policymakers stand a better chance of preserving that good will especially in the face of the he baby scandal if they give the concerns that do arise a fair hearing social media offers an unprecedented platform for doing just that crispr’s proponents should start by using that platform to clarify the following scientists are nowhere near being able to make designer babies they have barely figured out the genetic determinants of height there’s no telling how long it will take them to understand more complex traits like intelligence beauty and athleticism what they are close to doing is using tools like crispr to repair faulty genes that cause serious diseases clinical trials are already underway for hemophilia and sickle cell disease and these trials involve editing dna in adult study participants not in sperm eggs or embryos so the results good or bad can’t be passed on to offspring use existing levers of control before they try to enact a moratorium concerned parties should remember that there are already several checks and balances in place outside china to thwart scientists like dr he the bluntest of these tools legal prohibition is already being used in the united states where doctors and scientists are barred from editing human embryos while such stringent policies may help avoid the muddiness that led to the he scandal they have a clear downside they also block the use of less questionable technology for some desperate families mitochondrial gene transfer offers the only hope for preventing horrific diseases but because federal regulators have grouped it with other forms of embryo editing it’s prohibited in the united states there are better subtler ways to move forward lawmakers regulatory agencies patent holders ethics review boards funding foundations and professional journals all hold sway over how a technology is developed and used by working together to limit what is funded permitted or published they might create a dynamic and flexible process for safeguarding the public while still allowing promising work to progress it may be impossible to prevent truly rogue actors but it is possible to slow them down without stopping everyone else follow the new york times opinion section on facebook twitter nytopinion and instagram

2021-02-14T20:20:55.342Z - articleBody received: duncan campbell made his fortune with a timber investment fund he started in 1981 and sold eight years later but he never forgot his difficult childhood in portland ore with alcoholic parents and a father who was in and out of prison twice so when he had the time and wherewithal to devote to philanthropy in 1993 he said he chose to tackle a problem he knew about improving the lives of children at greatest risk not the top students at underperforming schools but the struggling ones who faced multiple impediments to success that is the story behind friends of the children which began in portland and is now in 15 cities with plans to be in 10 more by 2025 our core model is to take the most at-risk or most vulnerable child mr campbell said if there are 100 kindergarten kids we ask for the eight most troubled most challenging ones the organization has won plaudits from groups like the annie e casey foundation a philanthropy for poor children and researchers at stanford and the university of washington the organization has managed to address three persistent challenges that philanthropists at all levels face how can private money meaningfully influence a societal problem how can successes be replicated and how do you get other philanthropists to support what was essentially your idea mr campbell said he wanted to give a sense of stability to children who may not have it at home his organization hires a mentor or friend to work with just eight children who are selected in kindergarten and are expected to remain with the program until they finish high school the cost per child each year works out to about 10,000 the friends are paid a wage equivalent to or slightly higher than teachers salaries in the first years of their careers and they spend four hours every week with each of their eight students two hours in the classroom and two helping them in a variety of activities such as doing homework and going to museums and sporting events they couldn’t afford from the start friends of children logged data for all of these activities to get a sense of what was working and what wasn’t it found that the intensive interaction helped build trust increased the children’s positive social behavior and was more likely to keep the children out of trouble in many cases the children’s relationship with their parent or caregiver improved a recent study by researchers at the university of washington and washington state university found that the paid mentor approach provided children and their caregivers with a consistency and continuity that was critical to the program’s success but the data wasn’t always positive the selection of who got to be mentors made a difference they had to value education they also had to be empathetic one person did a great interview but after first six or nine months he wasn’t connecting with the children mr campbell said he eventually became a parole officer after the program had success in portland it began to expand to other cities with a ready-made offering when we go to new cities as long as they keep the core we’re willing to let them experiment with it mr campbell said it’s fidelity to the model versus learning and adapting over the past 25 years the los angeles chapter for example is focused on at-risk children of people who grew up in the foster-care system the chapter in austin tex was the first to translate all the materials into spanish and hired native spanish speakers as mentors the one in chicago focused on the problem of gang violence we’ve had different community solutions within the same program said terri sorensen chief executive of friends of the children kim starkey jonker chief executive of king philanthropies and a lecturer at stanford’s business school has written about friends in her book engine of impact she said the organization’s focus on one mentor for eight children helped it succeed and get results that could be replicated focus is so important she said nonprofits stretch themselves too thin at the same time ms jonker said the national organization knew what it could do well for all the chapters centralized data collection marketing accounting and other back office work and allowed chapters to adapt to their communities frequently tensions tear apart nonprofits she said the national organization reached out to professionals who were already established in the cities where there was interest in starting a chapter the executive director of the los angeles chapter thomas lee had 20 years of experience in child welfare there before joining friends last year mr lee was skeptical of the program at first he said but was won over by the small mentor-to-child ratio the competitive pay that would attract qualified candidates and the organization’s ability to retain mentors for seven years on average it’s better not to have a mentor than to have one for a short time he said it’s common for some kids to bounce around foster home to foster home six eight 15 times that doesn’t help create the strategies for long-term success that we’d want james tyrrell 29 went through the friends program in portland and had the same mentor john foster the entire time he credits it with helping him deal with the murder of his father when he was 2 his mother’s leaving him with her parents and addiction problems in his family it was consistency with that one positive adult in my life said mr tyrrell a court clerk south of portland if i didn’t have him i don’t know where i’d be he added that his mentor had told him you know where this path leads and you can go for it but why not try this one over here that’s what he did said mr tyrrell who graduated from college moved away from his family and now has a wife and two children david shapiro chief executive of mentor the national mentoring partnership and a board member of friends said that friends chose its mentors well but that mass-producing those bonds was difficult it’s much easier at a mcdonald’s to say wear the uniform and cook the fries at 112 degrees mr shapiro said with humans it’s a lot more difficult to standardize things and every human service agency is trying to figure that out now one of the criticisms of friends is how expensive it is to reach one child in a given year let alone over 12 years and getting other donors to give money to someone else’s idea is also difficult friends has succeeded with donors who are driven by data and measurable results it may also help that the charity focuses its marketing material on what it has achieved and aims to do not on mr campbell’s largess the organization also requires every chapter to raise three years of operating expenses about 1.5 million before it can start work no more than 40 percent of that money can come from one person to ensure that the program has broad support most recently friends received a multimillion-dollar grant over several years from the basketball great michael jordan that will go toward chapters in chicago and charlotte n.c it has received funding in seattle and los angeles from the former microsoft chief executive steve ballmer and his wife connie rachel arnold a partner at the private equity firm vista equity partners helped start a chapter in austin tex with her friend nancy pollard by raising 1.8 million from 50 families most of the donors hadn’t given to a program like this before ms arnold said we got donors on both sides of the political spectrum it had that broad appeal and data behind it since 2017 when the chapter started ms arnold’s group has raised 4 million if i’m going to invest my time and money into a program i want to see that impact she said it also really resonated she added because i know it to be true that it only takes one person to change a child’s life

and began writing furiously about the day that had haunted her for years in 2014 as a fresh-faced intern at china central television the state-run broadcaster she was asked to bring fruit to the dressing room of zhu jun a famous anchor it was there she said that mr zhu began forcibly kissing and groping her mr zhu has denied the accusations ms zhou’s essay about the experience which she posted online in july was an impassioned plea for women’s rights in china and a daring rebuke of the status quo it’s important for every girl to speak up and say what she has suffered she wrote in the essay which totaled more than 3,000 chinese characters we need to make sure society knows that these massacres exist soon after a friend of a friend reposted ms zhou’s essay on sina weibo a microblogging site it quickly spread across the chinese internet and inspired women to come forward with their own stories of abuse it became so popular that the chinese government intervened blocking comments and banning the state-run news media from covering her case ms zhou was overwhelmed in a matter of days she had emerged as a hero of china’s fledgling metoo movement a symbol of hope for young women tired of a patriarchal culture but she had also become a target for hate receiving hundreds of threatening messages then mr zhu 54 fired back in august he filed a lawsuit against ms zhou describing her accusations as blatantly fabricated and viciously spread he asked for about 95,000 in damages saying ms zhou had harmed his reputation and caused emotional distress ms zhou who is known in china by a nickname xianzi thought about retreating instead she became emboldened filing a lawsuit of her own against mr zhu claiming damage to her dignity let’s get ready to fight she wrote online since then ms zhou has become a leading feminist voice in china setting out to push the limits of china’s metoo movement which has struggled to gain footing in the face of censorship and reluctance by the authorities to investigate cases of sexual harassment and assault ms zhou has helped abused women seek justice accompanying them to police stations to file criminal reports she has criticized the government and society at large for not doing more to protect women against domestic violence and she has meticulously chronicled her legal battle publishing a diary about her triumphs and setbacks ms zhou acknowledges that women in china face many obstacles including vaguely defined laws on rape and harassment and a culture that often blames women not men in cases of sexual abuse but she says she is optimistic that attitudes will change once you light the spark that starts a fire she said recently at her home in east beijing it will have an impact on people’s hearts growing up in wuhan an

made it easier for other women to share their stories of abuse while china’s metoo movement is small complaints by women over the past year against college professors tech executives religious leaders and nonprofit executives among others have drawn wide attention more young people are willing to stand up and speak said huang yizhi a lawyer in beijing who specializes in gender discrimination cases they are no longer afraid ms zhou says she considers herself lucky not courageous because her case earned wide attention in the news media many women in china struggle to be heard she said noting that some victims wait in line for days at police stations only to be ignored the obstacles that other women experience is beyond my imagination she said it’s almost impossible for their cases to be resolved on her weibo page she offers a mix of inspirational slogans the light will come and reflections on her own struggles in one recent post she recounted how she disliked a photo taken by a journalist because it made her look like a powerless victim i am in a cage lacking courage insignificant flinching and escaping just like this photo she wrote i hope that girls can get more protection and that when they face the camera they can laugh openly on a smoggy october day ms zhou strode into a courthouse in northwest beijing for her first appearance in mr zhu’s lawsuit during the proceedings she was asked to provide evidence of the assault and to recount what had happened after the court session ended ms zhou nervous and frightened said she felt so tired that she wanted to vomit at a sidewalk news conference a journalist asked if she felt she was under pressure ms zhou paused for a moment taking stock of her ordeal this is something i must tackle she said i don’t have a choice

extended his country’s influence with increased trade and military deployments and he raised living standards with years of unbroken economic growth but after a failed 2016 coup mr erdogan embarked on a sweeping crackdown last year the economy wobbled and the lira plunged soon after he won re-election with even greater powers as cronyism and authoritarianism seep deeper into his administration turks are voting differently this time with their feet they are leaving the country in droves and taking talent and capital with them in a way that indicates a broad and alarming loss of confidence in mr erdogan’s vision according to government statistics and analysts in the last two to three years not only have students and academics fled the country but also entrepreneurs businesspeople and thousands of wealthy individuals who are selling everything and moving their families and their money abroad some 113,000 turks emigrated in 2018 a sharp increase over the previous year when more than 69,000 left the country according to the turkish institute of statistics turkey has seen waves of students and teachers leave before but this exodus looks like a more permanent reordering of the society and threatens to set turkey back decades said ibrahim sirkeci director of transnational studies at regent’s university in london and other analysts the brain drain is real mr sirkeci said the flight of people talent and capital is being driven by a powerful combination of factors that have come to define life under mr erdogan and that his opponents increasingly despair is here to stay they include fear of political persecution terrorism a deepening distrust of the judiciary and the arbitrariness of the rule of law and a deteriorating business climate accelerated by worries that mr erdogan is unsoundly manipulating management of the economy to benefit himself and his inner circle the result is that for the first time since the republic was founded nearly a century ago many from the old moneyed class in particular the secular elite who have dominated turkey’s cultural and business life for decades are moving away and the new rich close to mr erdogan and his governing party are taking their place one of those leaving is merve bayindir 38 who is relocating to london after becoming turkey’s go-to hat designer in the fashionable nisantasi district of istanbul we are selling everything she said in an interview during a return trip to istanbul last month to close what was left of her business mervebayindir which she runs with her mother and to sell their four-story house ms bayindir was an active participant in the 2013 protests against the government’s attempt to develop taksim square in istanbul she said she remains traumatized by the violence and fearful in her own city mr erdogan denounced the protesters as delinquents and after enduring arrests and harassment many have left the country there is so much discrimination not only cultural but personal the anger the violence is impossible to handle ms bayindir said if you had something better and you see it dissolving it’s a hopeless road thousands of turks like her have applied for business visas in britain or for golden visa programs in greece portugal and spain which grant immigrants residency if they buy property at a certain level applications for asylum in europe by turks have also multiplied in the last three years according to mr sirkeci who has studied the migration of turks to britain for 25 years he estimates that 10,000 turks have made use of a business visa plan to move to britain in the last few years with a sharp jump in applications since the beginning of 2016 that is double the number from 2004 to 2015 applications by turkish citizens for political asylum also jumped threefold in britain in the six months after the coup attempt and sixfold among turks applying for asylum in germany he said citing figures obtained from the united nations refugee agency the number of turks applying for asylum worldwide jumped by 10,000 in 2017 to more than 33,000 a large proportion of those fleeing have been followers of fethullah gulen the pennsylvania-based preacher who is charged with instigating the 2016 coup or people accused of being followers often on flimsy evidence tens of thousands of teachers and academics were purged from their jobs after the coup including hundreds who had signed a peace petition calling on the government to cease military action in kurdish cities and return to the peace process hundreds have taken up posts abroad mr erdogan has tried to make turkey more conservative and religious with a growing middle class and a tight circle of elites who are especially beholden to him for their economic success the flight of capital and talent is the result of this conscious effort by mr erdogan to transform the society said bekir agirdir director of the konda polling company with the help of subsidies and favorable contracts the government has helped new businesses to emerge and they are rapidly replacing the old ones he said there is a transfer of capital underway he said it is social and political engineering ilker birbil a mathematician who faces charges for signing the peace petition and left turkey to take up a position at erasmus university rotterdam in the netherlands warned that the country was losing people permanently people who are leaving do not want to come back mr birbil said citing the polarized political climate in the country this is alarming for turkey i have received so many emails from students and friends who are trying to get out of turkey he said students are despairing of change partly because they have grown up with mr erdogan in power for 17 years said erhan erkut a founder of mef university in istanbul which teaches innovation and entrepreneurship this is the only government they have seen they do not know there is another possibility he said families are setting up businesses abroad for the next generation to inherit said mr sirkeci of regent’s university adding that many students at his private university fell into that category at least 12,000 of turkey’s millionaires around 12 percent of the country’s wealthy class moved their assets out of the country in 2016 and 2017 according to the global wealth migration review an annual report produced by afrasia bank most of them moved to europe or the united arab emirates the report said turkey’s largest business center istanbul was listed among the top seven cities worldwide experiencing an exodus of wealthy people if one looks at any major country collapse in history it is normally preceded by a migration of wealthy people away from that country the report said mr erdogan has reviled as traitors businesspeople who have moved their assets abroad as the turkish economy began to falter pardon us we do not forgive he warned in a speech at the foreign economic relations board a business association in istanbul in april the hands of our nation would be on their collars both in this world and in the afterlife behavior like this cannot have a valid explanation mr erdogan added his comments came amid reports that some of turkey’s largest companies were divesting in turkey several such companies have made significant transfers of capital abroad amid fears they would be targeted in the post-coup crackdown or as the economy began to contract one is the turkish food giant yildiz holding which came under fire on social media as being linked to mr gulen’s movement soon after yildiz rescheduled 7 billion of debt and sold shares of its turkish biscuit maker ulker to its london-based holding company essentially transferring the family’s majority holding of ulker out of reach of turkish courts yildiz representatives did not immediately respond to requests for an interview but after publication of this article they said that its companies were in no way associated with the gulenist movement which it called a terrorist group and that the transfer of its debt and shares to its london-based holding company had no impact on its company’s commitment to and operations in turkey billions of dollars have fled turkey in the last couple of years especially after the coup attempt when people started to feel threatened said mehmet gun the owner of a law firm in istanbul ms bayindir the designer began slowly moving her company to london two years ago in turkey she had half a dozen workers and a showroom but now she designs and makes the hats herself out of a rented atelier in london i could have stayed in istanbul she said i would be better off but life in turkey had become so tense she said that she fears civil strife or even civil war could develop between erdogan supporters and their opponents now when i come here i don’t see the same istanbul she does not have energy anymore she looks tired ms bayindir said me not wanting to come here is a big big thing because i am one of those people who is in love with the city itself

self-help books i’ve been forced to out myself i love them not to improve myself of course since other than my looks and personality and value system i’m perfect no i love them because the good ones can give you a little life jolt that’s as useful as a double espresso the trick to reading these books is to heed one of the primary tenets of the recovery movement take what you need and leave the rest alas marianne power didn’t get the memo power a british freelance journalist and blogger believed everything about herself needed overhauling she knew she was a good person but she was to use that wonderful expression crap at daily life the book jacket shows an adorable slim redhead but she hated her thighs and her teeth and her unwashed ginger hair so wash it i think about 20 times reading along she hated her drinking and debt she hated the fact that she was in her mid-30s and still didn’t have a serious relationship power had been a self-help junkie for more than a decade like eating chocolate cake or watching old episodes of friends i read self-help for comfort these books acknowledged the insecurities and anxieties i felt but was always too ashamed to talk about they made my personal angst seem like a normal part of being human reading them made me feel less alone there was also the fantasy element the promise of being more confident and efficient richer more successful even taller really amazon lists a surprising number of books on how to grow taller in those years of reading self-help books did power turn her life around no she did not being human she read and read and did nothing but she thought what if she actually gave herself over to one solid year of self-improvement following the tenets of a variety of her favorite books to the letter each month she would follow a different book so while reading susan jeffers’s feel the fear and do it anyway she sky-dived posed naked for a life-art class and tried stand-up comedy arguably more terrifying than jumping out of a plane with kate northrup’s money a love story she decided to face her debt head on and get to the root of why she had overdrafts on all her credit cards trying to be serious about money was so difficult she then decided to follow the secret a book by rhonda byrne whose basic principle is that you don’t need to do anything but wish and visualize to make great things happen so she goes from watching every penny to writing herself fake 100,000 checks and eating whatever she wants because if you really believe money and men and houses and weight loss will come your way it’s surprising to discover that the secret wasn’t written by a 5-year-old but maybe not surprising to learn that it has sold millions of copies and so it goes walking on hot coal with tony robbins rejection therapy something something with eckhart tolle that i personally will never understand but it was good enough for oprah and paris hilton so what do i know still the misery i started to see how self-help can be dangerous for someone like me power writes i was too busy reading books spouting affirmations and dreaming big to get on with silly stuff like earning enough money to pay the bills power occasionally brings the funny her description of one bad date was a genuine bridget jones moment he sounded interesting he thought so too i spent two hours being run over by his voice but the navel gazing and the guilt about the navel gazing make her go a bit mad about halfway through her journey she pushes friends and family away drinks excessively bolts from perfectly lovely men and continues to avoid washing her hair some of those closest to her begin to avoid her but all have an annoying way of showing up again to tell her that despite her self-loathing the rest of the world doesn’t see her the way she sees herself as a writerly contrivance you can do this once or twice when you do it over and over the reader begins to think maybe she skimped on the self-help books about writing the contradiction at the heart of many self-help books is that you’re supposed to accept yourself more while simultaneously changing to create a better you i say pick one if you’re making daily vision boards and writing yourself fake checks then the chances of embracing the life you have are kind of slim if you’re doing daily affirmations to yourself in the mirror naked learning to love your cottage cheese thighs that’s great but the chances of losing those thighs aren’t so great either takeaway from self-help is fine but instead power pingpongs between the two help me is filled with epiphanies that are unceremoniously discarded a few pages later perhaps that’s the point of the book but this can be a little exhausting diverting and often amusing as it can be to join power on her george plimpton-like adventure through some of the classics of self-help readers won’t have trouble anticipating the happy ending it involves nature and friends and a baby not her own lesson learned happiness comes from appreciating the little things now it was time to stop thinking about myself to look out rather than in to live life rather than analyze it unless there’s an offer for a sequel then all bets are off

2021-02-14T20:21:33.381Z - articleBody received: washington house democrats faced sustained partisan fire on tuesday over their ambitious elections overhaul bill a top priority for the new democratic leaders who must answer charges that their efforts to counter partisan gerrymandering and ease access to the polls strain the constitutional reach of congress the house judiciary committee’s inaugural hearing of the 116th congress was dedicated to the voting and ethics rules overhaul known as the for the people act which democratic representatives have trumpeted as their signature legislative priority but its reception underscored the challenges the bill will face in a divided capitol the bill would turn the drawing of congressional boundaries over to nonpartisan commissions promote more transparency in campaign contributions and expand the public financing system for house and presidential candidates the broader issue is what kind of country america is and should be said representative jerrold nadler of new york the chairman of the committee but senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the majority leader renewed his criticism of the bill dismissing it as a one-sided power grab meant to empower and protect democratic politicians this sprawling comprehensive proposal is basically the far left’s entire christmas wish list where our nation’s political process is concerned mr mcconnell a longtime opponent of campaign finance disclosures said in remarks on the senate floor again declaring that the bill may pass the house but not the senate for democrats passage of such a sweeping measure is not necessarily the point the bill the first of the new house forms something of a platform for the 2020 campaign democrats on the committee seized the opportunity to press for the bill’s efforts to counter state tactics to remove voters from the rolls and require automatic registration for eligible voters many of the issues they believe will have bipartisan appeal beyond washington in a country convinced that the capital is rife with corruption and in the thrall of the rich and connected this should be a bipartisan issue and yet there is not a single republican member of congress that’s a co-sponsor said vanita gupta who testified before the panel in her role as the president and chief executive of the leadership conference on civil and human rights republican lawmakers on the committee vociferous in their condemnation and occasionally inflammatory in their language argued that the bill violated the right of states to control their own elections and decide their own districts representative ken buck republican of colorado chalked it up to the democratic party’s long history of stealing elections representative doug collins of georgia the committee’s ranking republican said contrary to its name this bill takes power away from the people and it does this by violating the constitution mr collins of georgia argued that the long lines in his state on election day which stretched for hours largely because of technical difficulties should be applauded as a sign that people there wanted to vote democrats in georgia led by their nominee for governor stacey abrams repeatedly accused republicans of suppressing the minority vote and decreasing access to the polls representative lucy mcbath a freshman democrat from suburban atlanta said she witnessed firsthand voter suppression in the state of georgia having come through those very elections in november the bill’s proposal to effectively end the practice of gerrymandering by establishing nonpartisan commissions to outline congressional districts and prevent the consolidation of single-party power exposed another fissure in the committee representatives guy reschenthaler republican of pennsylvania bemoaned entities with no accountability to the voters imposing district lines a reference to his state’s supreme court redistricting pennsylvania last year representative madeleine dean a democrat who won one of the new pennsylvania districts reminded the room that i wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for that decision republicans chose to direct most of their questions toward hans von spakovsky of the heritage foundation and j christian adams of the public interest legal foundation both members of the trump administration’s commission to investigate voter fraud which disbanded without any real evidence of corruption having an omnibus federal bill to fix everything is not the sort of thing that the constitution intended mr adams told the house panel in a testy exchange with mr von spakovsky and mr adams representative karen bass democrat of california questioned whether brian kemp of georgia should have recused himself as secretary of state overseeing the election as he ran for that state’s governorship after mr von spakovsky dismissed descriptions of problems in the 2018 elections as wildly exaggerated ms bass said that the suggestion is an embarrassment and people should be ashamed sherrilyn ifill the president and director-counsel of the naacp legal defense and educational fund urged lawmakers to not shy away from addressing limitations in certain states that prevent people primarily minority voters from successfully voting this is about whether or not we’re a healthy democracy she told lawmakers it is an embarrassment and a disgrace that we compel people to spend four hours standing in a line to exercise their right to participate in a fair process

2021-02-14T20:21:33.619Z - articleBody received: america’s corporate leaders are shrugging off a monthslong trade war a protracted government shutdown and other looming economic threats projecting that revenue growth in 2019 will be strong largely on the assumption that president trump will reach a deal with china they seem to be increasingly isolated in that view in earnings calls and interviews executives at some of the largest companies in the united states have played down what many economists and analysts see as possible obstacles to economic expansion both at home and abroad in addition to the shutdown and the trade war the challenges include recent signs of weakness in manufacturing data and slowing growth in china and europe business leaders are instead expressing confidence that the trump administration and chinese officials will strike a trade agreement before midnight on march 2 when tariffs on chinese imports are set to more than double and keep the economy humming we think the trade talk is going to be winding down over the next two or three months the government shutdown will be figured out kelly king the chief executive of bb&t corporation said last week while discussing the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings in a conference call with analysts marianne lake jpmorgan chase’s chief financial officer was similarly upbeat in comments to reporters last week put aside the shutdown and china trade and all that ms lake said the underlying statistics of the global economy are not bad jamie dimon the bank’s chief executive said the same day that he remained confident that a trade agreement was near and that with the deadline looming enough will be done to kind of get an extension and hopefully complete the deal and mr trump continues to project confidence that a trade deal is within reach telling reporters on wednesday that we’re doing very well in our negotiation with china china very much wants to make a deal he said we’ll see what happens i like where we are right now corporate leaders are eager to continue what has been a sustained run of growth and historically high profits since the financial crisis their optimism defies gloomier predictions from chief financial officers nearly half of whom predicted in a duke university survey last year that there would be a recession in 2019 federal reserve officials continue to forecast solid growth for the year but they have signaled at least a temporary pause in interest rate increases as they wait to see if trade tensions and other headwinds slow down the economy executives appear to be putting their faith in a president who has portrayed himself as a deal maker but who has yet to broker agreements to fund government operations resolve the trade dispute with china or even win congressional approval for a new north american trade agreement if their confidence is misplaced companies could wind up confronting a steep drop in the financial markets and a contraction in business activity the economic impact of the shutdown is already being felt on tuesday analysts blamed it for discouraging some americans from buying homes in december when existing home sales experienced their largest decline since 2015 even mr trump’s normally bullish economic advisers have become slightly less sanguine in an interview on cnn on wednesday kevin hassett who chairs the white house council of economic advisers warned that the shutdown which is in its fifth week could pull economic growth to zero for the first quarter if it lasts through march mr hassett however insists that the damage will be short-lived and that growth will bounce back once federal workers receive their back pay larry kudlow director of the national economic council said tuesday that reaching a trade deal with china by the deadline would not be easy i acknowledge the degree of difficulty mr kudlow told reporters not all corporate executives are playing down the warning signs american companies like apple and fedex have already attributed lower revenue estimates partly to the trade war with china the shutdown and the trade war have helped to raise economic policy uncertainty in the united states and around the world according to indexes compiled by the economists steven j davis of the university of chicago’s booth school of business nick bloom of stanford university and scott ross baker of northwestern university’s kellogg school of management in december global uncertainty reached its highest level in more than 20 years of data according to the professors indexes one of the measures a monthly gauge of uncertainty in the united states rose to its highest level since 2013 the last time the government endured a prolonged shutdown on tuesday another of the indexes a daily-news-based measure of american uncertainty reached its highest level since immediately after britain shocked the world in 2016 by voting to leave the european union a third index of trade uncertainty has climbed as a result of the administration’s tariffs on imports from china and other countries professor davis has warned that the uncertainty has reached a point where it is deterring investment in an interview he said the effect was noticeable but not catastrophic it’s more like shooting off your little toe as opposed to shooting off your whole foot and probably here to stay the issues between the united states and china don’t lend themselves to an easy or early resolution he said so i expect that will continue for quite some time the financial markets have repeatedly jumped in response to news reports suggesting the united states and china are making progress toward a deal only to give back some gains when the good news goes unconfirmed the latest example came at the end of last week with reports of two different possible solutions to the impasse that white house officials ultimately shot down executives are mostly minimizing the prospect of the world’s two largest economies failing to reach agreement or that the shutdown could persist and materially dent business activity much as they minimized the chance of a shutdown even happening right before it began at a banking conference on dec 4 timothy j sloan wells fargo’s chief executive said he did not see a lot to be concerned about when asked about the outlook for the united states economy other chief executives made similar comments that week i feel like we’re trying to talk ourselves into a slowdown randall stephenson at&t’s chief executive said at a dec 6 event organized by the business roundtable in washington there are clouds on the horizon he added prompting mr dimon who was also onstage at the event to say which have always been there dennis muilenburg the chief executive of boeing and another panel participant added we can’t take this near-term volatility and let it distract us some analysts and investors worried that executives may be overconfident are warning against complacency there’s an implicit assumption that the china trade deal will get worked out based on the commentary by the banks in fourth-quarter earnings said mike mayo a bank analyst at wells fargo securities an absence of that would not be good the billionaire investor seth a klarman stirred the world economic forum in davos switzerland this week with a letter to clients that raised concerns about the health of the global economy including rising levels of public debt in wealthy countries and america’s diminishing leadership role in the world it can’t be business as usual amid constant protests riots shutdowns and escalating social tensions mr klarman wrote jeffrey sonnenfeld a professor at the yale school of management said that some of the executives public calm was an act in private he said many of them are very worried but they are scared to speak their minds and publicly criticize mr trump potentially provoking him into retaliating against their companies everyone is afraid of a vindictive response to their companies as individuals so they’ll play no big deal here in public he said professor sonnenfeld said he had surveyed business leaders including some fortune 500 chief executives who attended a leadership conference that yale hosted last month around 80 responded to questions about the trade war mr trump’s interactions with other world leaders and the partisan battles in washington their answers he said suggested they were more worried about the president’s erratic behavior than they had admitted publicly most said the biggest threat to financial market strength was political instability in the united states

2021-02-14T20:21:33.681Z - articleBody received: hours before the government shutdown began president trump scored a rare bipartisan victory when he signed a criminal justice bill aimed at reducing the number of nonviolent offenders in prison now the shutdown threatens to delay the law’s implementation the timeline in the bill was already ambitious said molly gill vice president of policy at famm an organization of families advocating criminal justice reform the shutdown isn’t helping one of the first steps in the law is to establish a system for evaluating inmates to determine which ones could be released early without threatening public safety under the law an arm of the justice department has until jan 21 to help establish a committee tasked with creating that system wyn hornbuckle a justice department spokesman and sheila jerusalem a spokeswoman for the national institute of justice declined to answer questions about whether the deadlines would be met the only justice department employees authorized to work during a shutdown are those specifically authorized by law to work on urgent matters such as national security empty offices and unanswered messages have compounded the confusion over the new law which is called the first step act as thousands of inmates and their families seek information about whether they will be set free in addition to creating a system that will allow some low-risk inmates to earn early release the new law also retroactively increases the number of days inmates receive off their sentences for good behavior inmates now get 54 days for each year of their sentence up from 47 a retroactive change that could potentially free as many as 4,000 inmates according to the marshall project a nonprofit news website covering the criminal justice system amadi busiris 50 who is serving out the tail end of a 30-year sentence for conspiracy to distribute drugs had been closely following news reports about the bill’s progress from his prison cell and then more recently from a halfway house in washington d.c where he has been sent to await his release in november after the law’s passage mr busiris believed that he would be able to walk free almost immediately but when he called his lawyer to start the process he was told that he would have to wait until after the shutdown he said the law passed but they are not making any moves he said adding that seven others in hope village the halfway house where he lives are in the same situation we are just stuck but because of the way the law was written inmates like mr busiris would have had to wait months before being released even without the government shutdown the law stipulates that sentences will only be recalculated after the new risk assessment tool is created a requirement that criminal justice reform advocates say amounts to an error in the way the legislation was drafted it absolutely makes no sense said jack donson a former case manager with the federal bureau of prisons who now runs his own consulting firm helping inmates navigate the system mr donson said the recalculation of time off for good behavior should not have been linked to the new risk assessment system george hartmann press secretary for senator chuck grassley republican of iowa and a member of the senate judiciary committee said that portion of the bill was inherited from a version passed by the house and that mr grassley was aware that questions had been raised about it i wouldn’t necessarily characterize it as a drafting error he said senator grassley definitely has his eye on it and intends to keep working with the administration on a way forward last week the bureau of prisons sent a notice to inmates explaining that they would have to wait we know that inmates and families are particularly interested in changes regarding good conduct time the letter read while this change may result in additional credit for inmates in the future it is not effective immediately nor is it applicable to all inmates

the opposition although it was unclear whether the olive branch was a genuine offer or just a delaying tactic in an interview with a russian news agency mr maduro also rejected calls for a new election his re-election last year has been widely disputed and the u.s and a number of european countries have called for a fresh vote if the imperialists want new elections let them wait until 2025

customers who come to support her efforts shutdown business remains brisk after nearly a month and she has no plans to stop the deal despite a growing financial strain the response on all sides has blown me away said ms mckay 32 who is part of an impromptu and largely uncoordinated effort by businesses and charities to help out an estimated 15,000 workers in the denver region who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay when word started to spread that we were doing this other people started showing up she said other customers have paid to sponsor families of furloughed

should just go ahead and apply for unemployment if i should look for maybe temporary work we’re going to need another income pretty soon the prospect that for no reason at all i may have to find another permanent job is very frustrating and it speaks to a kind of waste you know the taxpayers would have to fund the whole hiring process for my replacement i have an autoimmune condition that causes severe nerve pain and made the decision to cut back work hours so i could focus on my health and get more treatment but we can’t now get on my husband’s plan because my husband works for the

labor and charitable organizations is spreading slowly and unevenly across the united states as the longest federal shutdown in history staggers to its one-month mark predictions of pain that had been theoretical or theatrical in shorter shutdowns are now a reality for around 800,000 federal workers scattered through states red and blue the efforts range from the grass-roots to the institutional banks and credit unions have suspended late-payment fees on credit cards and some are offering low or no-interest bridge loans utilities and cellphone companies have also offered to help in varying degrees and mass transit systems in florida and other states are providing free or reduced-price rides for those who are furloughed or working unpaid even the f.b.i has been affected with a law enforcement charity setting up a food bank for agents in the bureau’s new york office the public does not realize the impact that a shutdown has on the f.b.i or on our families a bureau official wrote in an email this week to supporters of the nonprofit society of former special agents of the fbi i personally think we are so good at doing what we do every day that the public takes our work for granted the federal government has offered a mash-up of advice to unpaid workers and agencies have offered sample pushback letters to send to landlords and creditors who demand to be paid including some that suggested bartering repair work for discounts on rent that’s a total of 200 million in unpaid wages each workday haydee guzman an accounts management employee at the internal revenue service is receiving no paycheck and has nine mouths to feed seven children her medically disabled husband and herself the predicament pushed her to a food bank in san antonio where they live i didn’t want to wait until i would be completely out of funds said ms guzman 46 let me not wait too long to try to get this type of assistance because we don’t know how long this is going to be across the united states the response has been one of worry warmth and spontaneous action transportation security administration officers are reporting that airline passengers have offered words of encouragement hugs homemade casseroles gift cards and even cash despite airport slowdowns caused by an increase in sick calls by unpaid workers we had one lady offer an agent money said kirk p skinner the acting federal security director at tampa international airport who has been working without pay the agent said no so she just dropped a 5 bill on the ground he said the money was deposited in the lost-and-found bin we have a lot of hurricanes around here obviously and the response to this has been much more like the response in the aftermath of a hurricane than a shutdown added mr skinner a former marine who likened his task to keeping up troop morale businesses in areas with a substantial federal work force have responded with similar generosity they have offered freebies or steep discounts on nearly everything rented or sold meals groceries laser tag bowling flight school go-kart rentals zoos museums mini-golf massages movie and theater performances and gym memberships but as the shutdown drags on the need for a more coordinated effort is growing and the number of groups with the resources to make a real difference remains relatively small i remain an optimistic person by nature and american men and women are extraordinarily generous but this is stretching everyone’s resources to the limit said cari thomas a retired rear admiral and now the chief executive of coast guard mutual assistance which provides financial support for members of the force the group based in arlington va is one of a few with the resources to provide cash payouts to its members to offset the loss of pay ms thomas said the charity planned to send out checks of 1,000 to younger lower-paid coast guard employees in the next few days and 750 to those without dependent family members the organization which has only six full-time employees has already burned through its modest cash reserve taken out a 15 million line of credit and raised about 1.5 million from small donors the bulk payments would not have been possible without a one-time 15 million contribution from the usaa insurance company ms thomas said and the group is now looking for another similar contribution to bankroll a second two-week pay period the roots of washington’s budget dysfunction date to the 1970s here’s a look at past shutdowns and how they led to today’s this is very hard on people she said the people on duty are sad and they are angry and they are frustrated the civilian employees on furlough feel like they are letting the people in uniform who are still at work down we need this to stop many of the most effective responses to the shutdown have centered on providing workers with food a tangible and relatively easy issue to address the tampa airport was one of the first in the country to pull together local agencies including food banks and a united way chapter to create a one-stop resource center for as many as 700 t.s.a customs and border protection and federal aviation administration employees who are working without pay about 100 employees with an equal number of family members on average have been picking up food parcels at a pop-up food bank at a police training facility at the airport it is run by feeding tampa bay which typically assists low-income families representatives from utility companies and local transportation officials have also been on-site to offer assistance we have never done anything like this but i think this is not the last time we are going to be doing it said emily nipps a spokeswoman for the authority that runs the tampa airport the sense that the shutdown is part of a more lasting national crisis born of washington dysfunction is likely to have a long-term effect on food-relief groups that typically take care of the poor what has struck me is how overwhelmed and underprepared federal workers are for these circumstances where do i get food how do i get rental assistance how do i get help paying my utilities said kate maehr the executive director of the greater chicago food depository which distributes food to pantries throughout cook county federal employees shocked to find themselves in such circumstances have been full of questions about the process and confused about how to get assistance in chicago home to thousands of federal workers food pantries were loosening their usual requirements to allow government employees either furloughed or working unpaid to collect food clothing and other supplies care for real a food pantry on the city’s north side has seen an uptick in calls and visits since last week and is allowing anyone with government identification to receive goods we want to make sure they know it’s o.k to come to us said lyle allen the program’s executive director something as devastating as the federal shutdown just causes a catastrophe for their home life last week the oak park river forest food pantry in the chicago suburbs announced that it would serve any federal employee one person who sought food was a contract worker who depends on work with the federal government at least two people who volunteered at the pantry in recent days said they were furloughed michele zurakowski the pantry’s executive director expects the demand to rise with no sign of an end to the shutdown people are working through their personal safety nets right now she said

2021-02-14T20:26:40.864Z - articleBody received: [what you need to know to start the day get new york today in your inbox mayor bill de blasio pledged on wednesday to make new york the first city in the nation to require private employers to provide at least two weeks of paid vacation to all employees the proposal which requires city council approval comes a day after mr de blasio announced a 100 million effort to help ensure that the city’s health care resources are used by the uninsured including undocumented immigrants a move that immediately set up a contrast with republican leadership in washington mr de blasio appeared eager to billboard that contrast with both announcements leading to speculation among political consultants in new york city that his larger aim leading up to his state of the city address on thursday is to thrust his name back into the national conversation as a leader of progressive democratic principles mr de blasio did nothing to alter that impression during a news conference in city hall in which he presented his plan for paid time off as a link in the long history of workers rights initiatives going back to the new deal he said that he would travel the country very soon to encourage other cities and states to follow suit i’m focused on new york city but i know what we do here could have a huge impact on the rest of the country mr de blasio said i’m going to go out and talk about the things we’re doing here and the impact that they can make i’m going to push other leaders to take on these ideas i’m certainly going to push my party to support these kind of ideas from almost the moment he became mayor mr de blasio has looked to extend his political reach beyond new york city though his efforts have not always succeeded now in the second year of his second term the mayor seems to be renewing those efforts in earnest he revealed the health care plan in a national television interview on msnbc he announced the paid vacation plan which city officials say could benefit about half a million workers in the washington post but while the promise on health care largely amounted to improving customer service for coverage that has existed for decades the paid-vacation measure would be genuinely new no state or city in the united states has such a requirement according to city hall though puerto rico does guarantee paid time off the mayor presented a list of mostly european countries that he said require paid time off for workers we’re the exception and it’s a bad exception mr de blasio said of the united states the bill as described by city hall officials who did not share its text would largely mirror one introduced in 2014 by councilman jumaane williams of brooklyn the approach is modeled on the city’s paid sick leave law and would most likely apply to the same pool of roughly 3.4 million working new yorkers businesses with fewer than five employees would be exempt full and part-time workers at larger businesses would earn vacation time during the year up to 10 days time off we often treat it as a luxury it is not said mr williams a candidate for public advocate and frequent critic of mr de blasio who appeared with him at the news conference you cannot lead a healthy life if you do not have time off mr de blasio said he hoped the new rules would be voted on quickly but phased in smartly using data from the census and the federal bureau of labor statistics the city estimated that the law would affect some 500,000 workers mostly in non-unionized hotels retail restaurants and big-box stores most white-collar workers already get some form of paid vacation and unionized workers usually receive it as part of their contracts freelancers and contract employees would not be covered by the new rules the mayor said the effort to broaden his reach comes as mr de blasio has struggled with some local issues such as repairing public housing and implementing metrocard discounts for the poor it’s a good thing to have a mayor who thinks big and broadly said kenneth sherrill a professor emeritus of political science at hunter college but he sometimes does not seem to be terribly concerned with implementation the new regulations would be enforced by the city’s department of consumer affairs which would investigate complaints of noncompliance and potentially issue fines or penalties city officials have not determined the size of the fines city hall officials said they discussed the measure with economists but did not broach it with business leaders who seemed skeptical of it the new york business community got no heads-up on this national first announcement so apparently we are not the audience being addressed although local entrepreneurs will certainly be the victims said kathryn wylde of the partnership for new york city an influential business group james parrott director of economic and fiscal policies at the center for new york city affairs at the new school said that businesses that have already had to adjust to the state’s 15 minimum wage and the city’s paid sick-leave law might struggle to provide paid vacation too as labor costs have increased over the last five years businesses may have increased efficiency by taking the low-hanging fruit mr parrott said it’s a fair question of whether there are more ways to increase efficiency the mayor did not consult with the democrat-dominated city council as he shaped his paid vacation plan according to several people with knowledge of the discussions council members were not told until the morning but the measure did not appear likely to meet resistance at the council where the speaker corey johnson has been an enthusiastic backer of progressive policies councilman williams applauded the mayor for following his lead i’m just glad that the mayor is a big proponent of this now he said in an interview and i’m even prouder that we have a speaker who is willing to engage in the conversation so i think it is a good day

2021-02-14T20:26:40.954Z - articleBody received: new delhi international insurance companies on friday threatened to end travel coverage to nepal if the government did not crack down on elaborate helicopter rescue scams that target foreigners trekking near mount everest and other high-altitude peaks last year investigations by the nepali government and traveller assist a medical assistance company based in ireland found that some trek operators guides helicopter companies and even doctors and hospitals had conspired to bilk millions of dollars from insurance companies by pushing for emergency mountainside evacuations for minor illnesses or when simpler treatment options were available the guides preyed on trekkers when they were most vulnerable trudging up remote trails cold wet sick confused and miles from any well-serviced towns the nepali government found evidence that some guides went as far as intentionally making hikers ill by spiking their food with large amounts of baking soda which can cause vomiting diarrhea and other ailments and then calling for an emergency helicopter evacuation these evacuations can cost as much as 40,000 each depending on how many trekkers are on board and insurance companies are often stuck with the bill jonathan bancroft the managing director of traveller assist which represents three insurance underwriters questioned why the government has yet to file charges against 17 nepali companies accused of fraud or tax evasion in a letter delivered to nepal’s minister of tourism on friday mr bancroft wrote that if the government did not bring charges against these companies all of which are reportedly still in business the insurance underwriters would cut off coverage for nepal starting from feb 15 to be clear this is an ultimatum mr bancroft wrote if our clients stop issuing travel insurance policies in nepal it won’t be long until other insurers do the same this will have a devastating effect on the tourism industry in nepal and your country’s reputation the three insurance underwriters which control 23 travel insurance brands that cover over 100,000 travelers to nepal annually were not identified in the letter their market share is sizable just over a million tourists visited nepal last year many of them embarked on remote hikes flanked by some of the world’s highest mountains most trekking operators in nepal are upstanding and see client safety as a key concern aware of the risks associated with traveling to high altitudes many visitors buy travel insurance costing several hundred dollars opting for plans that include emergency helicopter rescues to ensure proper acclimatization on the way to places like everest base camp which sits more than 17,000 feet above sea level hikes are spread over days but according to government officials insurers and employees in nepal’s tourism industry some mountain guides earn commissions from trekking operators by pressuring inexperienced hikers to be flown back to kathmandu the capital at the first minor signs of altitude sickness trekkers are dissuaded from exploring other options like taking medicine going to clinics along the hiking route or simply descending a few thousand feet which solves many cases of altitude sickness as a scare tactic the common cold or fatigue are sometimes purposefully mischaracterized as acute mountain sickness which can be deadly in an advanced stage in kathmandu hospitals involved in the fraud perform unnecessary tests exaggerate symptoms and even hold on to trekkers passports to prevent them from leaving in another version of the scam healthy hikers agree to a helicopter rescue in exchange for a cut of money or a free ride off the trail when bills are submitted for insurance claims helicopter companies and hospitals inflate prices for their services multiple insurance claims are submitted for a single helicopter ride when more than one trekker is on board some trekking operators which act as brokers and take a percentage of rescue fees from helicopter companies make more money through evacuations than they do charging for hikes the typical profit margin for each hiker heading to everest might be just a few hundred dollars participating in the scam could net operators thousands of dollars in kickbacks the investigation last year by traveller assist found evidence of fraud by four hospitals and 13 helicopter charter and rescue companies the separate investigation by nepal’s government identified most of those same companies a few dozen more trekking companies are thought to be involved to say this is a complex problem is an understatement said danny kaine head of assistance at traveller assist fraud and corruption in the helicopter rescue industry in nepal are so ingrained in some companies it has become an accepted way of doing business insurance companies initially struggled to track the fraud though it has been occurring since at least the early 2010s but over the last few years the number of insurance claims from nepal shot up dramatically alarmed at the increase travel insurance companies created internal blacklists of nepali helicopter companies and hospitals posted advisories warning trekkers of the scam and raised premiums traveller assist found that about 1,600 helicopter rescues had occurred in nepal from january to august 2018 out of which 35 percent were considered fraudulent costing insurers some 4 million in losses in september nepal’s government introduced a new monitoring program that required companies to submit bills to the department of tourism to ensure that they were genuine but mr bancroft in his letter wrote not a single charge has been laid from september to december 2018 traveller assist determined that about 15 percent of some 1,600 rescues during that period were fraudulent in interviews nepali officials blamed each other ghanshyam upadhaya a spokesman for the ministry of tourism said his office had sent their findings to other ministries health home finance and civil aviation but was waiting to hear back ramkrishna subedi a spokesman for the home ministry shifted responsibility back to the tourism ministry to take action another government official who was formerly at the tourism ministry speaking on condition of anonymity said that nothing had been done on the issue penalties could spill out of the country madhab prasad bhattarai a nepali lawyer said corporate fraud was a criminal offense in nepal and tax evasion which some companies are also accused of could be considered a criminal or civil offense both are punishable by fines and jail time but because fraud was committed against travel insurance companies based outside nepal the cases could be escalated to law enforcement agencies in countries like the united states or britain foreign travel insurance companies that continue to entertain claims from nepali companies charged with fraud could also be investigated said mr kaine of traveller assist it’s a vicious circle he said some insurers and assistance providers are facilitating the fraud by paying large invoice amounts without any questions being asked this makes our job all the more difficult

2021-02-14T20:26:41.163Z - articleBody received: a 34-year-old man from houston who is said to have sent a résum and cover letter seeking a job with the islamic state has been seized on a battlefield in syria an american-backed militia fighting the militants said sunday dear director i am looking to get a position teaching english to students in the islamic state the texan warren christopher clark is said to have written in a letter found in an iraqi house once occupied by the militants mr clark once worked as a substitute teacher in the fort bend independent school district in sugar land tex according to his father and seemed prepared to draw on that experience i believe that a successful teacher can understand a student’s strengths and weaknesses he wrote and is able to use that understanding to help students build on their understanding of the english language a university of houston graduate mr clark moved to saudi arabia to teach english and then taught english for three months in turkey according to documents recovered in a house in mosul iraq mr clark’s résum ends in june 2015 indicating that he probably joined the islamic state after that his father warren clark 69 described his son as a humanitarian and rejected any suggestion that he would throw in his lot with a group like isis my son would not be involved in anything along those lines he said mr clark said he had learned of his son’s letter to the terrorist group on the news basically and declared my son doesn’t have an evil thought in his mind about hurting anyone the militia that announced mr clark’s capture the syrian democratic forces said he had been seized along with a man they described as another american zaid abed al-hamid the militia said it had also detained other foreign fighters including citizens of ireland and pakistan the men were taken during an operation targeting the islamic state’s last pocket of control in northern syria according to a statement issued by the syrian democratic forces the kurdish-led and american-supported militia that is fighting to take back territory from the militants only four other americans are known to have been captured on the battlefield in iraq and syria according to a database maintained by george washington university’s program on extremism very few americans have returned to the united states after joining the terrorist group if mr clark and mr hamid whose surname was also spelled al-hamed are extradited to the united states they would be only the 15th and 16th american adults to return from joining isis in iraq and syria the number is minuscule said seamus hughes the deputy director of the program at george washington to put it in context the brits are talking about hundreds of returnees mr clark’s letter and accompanying résum which were authenticated by mr hughes point to his naïvet and suggest that he was drawn to the islamic state’s promise of building a muslim-only state little is known about the american said to be captured alongside mr clark beyond his age 35 the syrian democratic forces did not say what state he is from describing him only as originally from the united states there were indications however that mr hamid might not really be american his name appears in a database of 130 trinidadians who joined the islamic state that is maintained by simon cottee a senior lecturer in criminology at the university of kent who tracks the group mr cottee is working on a book about isis fighters from the caribbean nation mr hamid has been identified as an extremist since at least 2011 when he was detained in trinidad as part of an alleged plot to kill the country’s prime minister according to mr cottee’s database mr hamid joined the terrorist group on april 6 2014 along with his wife and his three children a much plumper mr hamid appears in an isis video sitting by a languid stream railing about how his family could not practice their faith in trinidad mr cottee said that he had shared the mug shot published by the kurdish militia with people who knew mr hamid in trinidad and that they had confirmed his identity still mr cottee did not rule out that the possibility that mr hamid is a dual citizen a similarly spelled name zaid abdul-hamid appears in a cache of isis registration forms indicating that he provided a reference for a recruit from trinidad and tobago when that recruit joined the group in 2014 the form indicates that mr abdul-hamid was in raqqa syria at that time col scott rawlinson a spokesman for the american-led military coalition in baghdad said in an email that the coalition was aware of open-source reports of reportedly american citizens currently in custody believed to be fighting for isis however we are unable to confirm this information at this time he said the incident is under investigation last month president trump’s announcement that the united states would withdraw forces stationed in syria prompted the resignation of his defense secretary and accelerated the resignation of the white house’s senior envoy to the fight against the islamic state both defense secretary jim mattis and the envoy brett mcgurk said that the unexpected withdrawal amounted to abandoning america’s allies in the region especially the syrian democratic forces in recent days white house officials have softened mr trump’s stance saying that the withdrawal will not happen right away and that it will be carried out in a coordinated manner on sunday the president’s national security adviser john r bolton appeared to reverse course telling reporters in jerusalem that the pullout was conditional on defeating the last remnants of isis and on turkey’s ensuring the safety of america’s kurdish allies according to three separate reports including an assessment by the pentagon’s inspector general the islamic state still maintains a force of 20,000 to 30,000 members in iraq and syria the last time the group was declared defeated was in 2010 when the c.i.a estimated that it was down to just 700 fighters

university after graduation in 2008 mrs pepper then zoe cohen moved to manhattan and roomed with a friend in murray hill mr pepper headed to law school in philadelphia at the university of pennsylvania as a summer associate at milbank tweed hadley mccloy in the financial district he watched from his office window as the undulating new york by gehry building then known as beekman tower rose on spruce street so when he finished law school and went to work full time at the firm he and mrs pepper moved into a one-bedroom rental there they liked its distinctive architectural qualities and its many amenities and the location couldn’t be beat i had been told the long hours that a big law firm would entail particularly as a junior associate so i thought it made sense to live close to the office mr pepper said his walk to work took five minutes mrs pepper rode the subway to midtown where she now is the director of rooms operations at the westin new york at times square last year mr pepper’s firm announced its plan to move to hudson yards it was good news for the couple they could move to a location where both could walk to work we both work crazy hours but spencer’s hours are super unpredictable mrs pepper said he could be on a deal where he doesn’t come home for two straight days so having that flexibility to come home and take a quick shower or quick nap that is super critical for him although her work hours are more stable i get called in a lot she said i will run there in a heartbeat for anything the peppers both 32 were also up for exploring a developing neighborhood as they had done when they moved to the financial district in 2011 at the time mrs pepper said there weren’t any good restaurants we had to go to tribeca to get a salad the couple went on the hunt for a rental in late spring intending to line up a one-bedroom before their july wedding so they could move in post-honeymoon they wanted a new amenity-filled building for themselves and andiamo their italian greyhound we kind of get this high on new buildings mrs pepper said they are so exciting it’s so fun being the first person to live in your apartment no one has sat on your toilet seat their budget was 5,000 to 7,000 a month with some research on streeteasy mr pepper narrowed down the options to a handful of possibilities in and north of hudson yards i have a lot less patience for that stuff and spencer is super organized and detailed mrs pepper said i am extremely decisive whereas he will crunch numbers and weigh all the pros and cons mima an eight-year-old rental building on 42nd street east of 10th avenue fit their criteria but mr pepper said it didn’t have that brand-spanking-new feeling that we really wanted the eugene on west 31st street was closer to his office but farther from hers they weren’t keen on the interior finishes or the location next to dyer avenue the lincoln tunnel entrance and exit ramp where impatient traffic seemed hazardous then there was oskar on 11th avenue near 43d street with just 164 apartments the peppers found the small size more appealing than a massive building with hundreds of units it felt to them like a boutique hotel when they visited it wasn’t quite finished it seems like the apartment is being built for you mr pepper said they saw several iterations of one-bedrooms some with balconies and many with interesting hallways and curves the building also offers access to most of the amenities at sky across the street the largest rental building in new york with nearly 1,200 units both were developed by the moinian group the peppers were able to sign the lease nearly two months in advance they chose a one-bedroom with no balcony but with an extra half bathroom for 6,200 a month and received three free months on a 27-month lease with the monthly rent netting out to 5,511 they also received six free months at life time athletic at sky a gym and spa that normally costs 199 per person per month the one-time pet fee for andiamo was 750 the peppers who arrived in late summer faced some construction-related issues like a sporadic lack of hot water and workers coming and going from their apartment it was certificate-of-occupancy ready but not our-crazy-attention-to-detail ready mrs pepper said now she strives to take a fitness class every day usually on her walk home from work mr pepper goes in the morning in their sunny one-bedroom which looks straight down 11th avenue i feel like i am floating in the middle of new york city mrs pepper said being on an avenue in midtown however is proving louder than being on a small street downtown late on weekday nights there is a honking contest outside she said they enjoy the small details like a hidden refrigerator and dishwasher closet lights that turn on when the door opens and a walk-in shower rather than a tub their entry door uses a key fob plans call for the building to go even more high tech eventually people will be able to open their doors with their smartphones said toby gingold oskar’s leasing manager the peppers especially appreciate having that second half bath across the hall so when mrs pepper rises extra early for work she won’t wake her husband she also loves walking to work getting that extra hour of sleep is truly life-changing she said as for mr pepper his office move won’t happen until february so he has temporarily assumed a subway commute i cannot wait to be able to walk to work again he said email thehunt@nytimes.com for weekly email updates on residential real estate news

2021-02-14T20:40:46.536Z - articleBody received: at first glance the decision by congressional republican leaders on monday to strip representative steve king of his committee assignments for remarks last week defending white supremacy last week appears to be an example of the party stepping in to police its own extremists but it’s actually the opposite the condemnations of mr king now in his ninth term in congress come only after years of ignoring his white-nationalist rhetoric and address what is merely the tip of a vast iceberg people took little notice when over the weekend president trump approvingly cited a column from pat buchanan about the border wall that described the democratic party as hostile to white men the president’s shout-out was a reminder that the republican party’s dalliance with radicalism goes beyond his presidency and long predates it for more than a half-century two characteristics have defined what we term the long new right a politics centered on mobilizing group resentment and conflict and a determined refusal to police boundaries by building an electoral coalition to give it power and winning factional battles to control its agenda the long new right ultimately captured the republican party and fatefully rendered it permeable to extremist forces it lacks either the will or ability to challenge unless party leaders draw and enforce meaningful boundaries and develop a more appealing economic agenda for the republican rank-and-file the party will continue its dance with extremists after mr trump departs the scene today’s republican party both pro and anti-trump tells a shared origin story a remnant of conservative thinkers toiling in the wilderness of the postwar liberal consensus developed an ideological agenda blending traditional morality and free-market economics popularized it in the pages of national review and inspired the movement to win barry goldwater the republican presidential nomination in 1964 and eventually to put ronald reagan in the white house missing from this story is a key point postwar american conservatism was forged in battles over extremists a formative fight for many movement founders concerned senator joe mccarthy’s reckless crusade against communists before founding national review william f buckley then in his 20s was a co-author of a 1954 book that offered what might be called a full-throated anti-anti-mccarthy case it separated mccarthy the flawed man from mccarthyism the worthy program of action against those in our land who help the enemy on civil rights buckley would eschew even such anti-anti arguments in favor of openly defending jim crow in the later 1950s and early 1960s buckley’s circle of movement ideologists regularly intermingled with harder-edged actors it was a world populated by conservative book clubs and advocacy groups bible-pounding anti-communist crusaders and the secretive john birch society with its tens of thousands of members and well-earned reputation for gonzo conspiracism contrary to movement myth buckley did not purge the birchers from the movement in the 1960s national review articles in 1962 singled out the birch society’s founder robert welch for personal condemnation while sparing ordinary members of his organization a more full-throated attack on the group followed three years later but only after goldwater’s defeat goldwater too criticized welch personally but went no further his campaign was powered by best-selling tracts like phyllis schlafly’s a choice not an echo steeped in the birchers baroquely paranoid style a who’s who of the hard right including the anti-semite gerald l.k smith enthusiastically supported his candidacy and the campaign did little to disavow them even the party establishment that resisted goldwater’s nomination blanched at calling out extremism a proposed platform plank at the convention denouncing extremism and explicitly naming the birch society failed to find support even from dwight eisenhower and george romney by the early 1980s long into the birch society’s decline republicans would feel less reason than ever to hide or apologize for engaging birchers the society’s magazine the review of the news featured interviews with the likes of dick cheney and chuck grassley the next generation of conservative movement activists including paul weyrich a key mentor of newt gingrich morton blackwell and richard viguerie adopted a more pugilistic approach that brought together radical and mainstream elements on the right in the 1970s they avoided traditional republican small-government political appeals in favor of mobilizations over busing abortion and gay rights while courting the segregationist george wallace’s followers and brokering a fateful alliance between christian evangelicals and the republican party the new right formed think tanks advocacy groups and political action committees to do the work they didn’t trust the formal party to do parties are no more than instruments temporary and disposable declared the maryland congressman bob bauman at 1975’s conservative political action conference this troublemaking activism irked party officials like ronald reagan’s first republican national committee chairman richard richards who called the outside groups loose cannonballs on the deck of a ship but their approach eventually came to dominate thanks to the expanding right-wing media ecosystem primary voters and direct-mail fund-raising dollars the refusal to police boundaries evolved from an ethos to a structural feature of the political world built by the long new right for decades the long new right has depended on buy-in from moneyed interests within the republican coalition the grass-roots right may have disliked the plutocrats economic agenda but they repeatedly accepted it to gain access to power for their part the plutocrats may have regarded the new right as uncouth and their social agenda divisive but they too preferred it to any available alternative the trump presidency featuring fights over a wall with mexico alongside corporate tax cuts embodies this enduring bargain whatever president trump’s fate as long as the core economic agenda of the party’s funders remains unpopular republicans will have to stoke group resentment to win elections while the party doesn’t lack for proposals that would update its outdated plutocrat-friendly agenda see the books and proposals from oren cass henry olsen and figures around the niskanen center to name a few changing this dynamic will not come easy certainly not as easy as various never trumpers imagine the hard sustained political work in the trenches will require both meaningful shifts in the republican party’s program toward policies that speak to the material welfare of its constituents and robust party organization with the means and the will to contain the fever swamps in the long run the danger on the right is not just republicans problem but all of ours american democracy depends on the grand old party learning to secure its own borders sam rosenfeld an assistant professor of political science at

compliment the three sisters the infernal goddesses of ancient mythology born from the blood shed by uranus when he was castrated by his son were known for relentlessly hounding men but the furies took vengeance on wicked men who hurt women and swore false oaths so i took it as a compliment the capital has suddenly been infused with the spirit of the furies after many false springs and discouraging backlashes we are finally experiencing a revolutionary assertion of women’s power that is transforming congress kill bill”-style the fiery democratic women keep coming driven by vengeance against the wicked man in the white house with the history of hurting women and swearing false oaths swooping toward 2020 the moment of truth for donald trump that is also aptly the centennial of

california lauren underwood of illinois and jahana hayes of connecticut tracked mitch mcconnell to petition him to have a vote to reopen the government the senate majority leader has been trying to

erosion of his base we are getting crushed trump told his acting chief of staff mick mulvaney according to the times with her taunt that the president could make his state of the union address in his own office pelosi continued the strategy of denying the attention addict attention with his cancellation of her trip to afghanistan trump simply underscored that pelosi has been to our war zones many times while trump has only been to iraq once after being shamed into it asked if trump was retaliating after her threat to cancel the state of the union pelosi offered the perfect sly riposte i don’t

2021-02-14T20:40:46.894Z - articleBody received: it was a legendary hollywood battle one filled with so much back-stabbing and subterfuge that vanity fair likened it to a horror movie wall street as directed by hitchcock for months starting in the fall of 1993 two media titans sumner m redstone and barry diller fought each other for what was then the entertainment industry’s ultimate prize paramount pictures the 62-acre studio behind classic films like the godfather and chinatown and contemporary blockbusters like top gun and beverly hills cop the home entertainment boom was showering hollywood with cash but paramount was more than a money machine legacy studios like paramount founded in the 1910s operating sumptuous soundstage complexes and controlling vast film libraries rarely came up for sale owning one made you a permanent power player a certified member of the cultural elite with a bid of 9.75 billion or 17 billion in today’s money mr redstone’s viacom took the spoils don’t tell me i don’t buy you anything for your birthday he told his then-wife phyllis as they celebrated with lawyers at the 21 club in new york flash forward 25 years and paramount once again finds itself at the center of a battle only this time the historic studio is not the belle of the hollywood ball not even remotely today paramount is fighting for its very existence almost slapstick mismanagement by viacom cleaving off a lucrative tv business firing the horror maestro jason blum missing the opportunity to buy marvel entertainment describing steven spielberg as completely immaterial has left paramount on life support the studio racked up nearly 900 million in losses between 2016 and 2018 it has placed last at the domestic box office for seven years running the 29-soundstage paramount lot is long overdue for improvements 700 million in upgrades unveiled in 2011 have yet to happen paramount along with the rest of hollywood is also colliding with silicon valley netflix which occupies a rented office tower six blocks from paramount headquarters has been swallowing the entertainment business whole this year the streaming service will pump out about 90 movies including documentaries to compare the five conventional studios left standing paramount universal sony disney and warner bros will make about that many combined paramount is set to contribute 13 the old-line film business is only going to become tougher as streaming services proliferate apple intends to roll out its multibillion-dollar tv and movie offering in the months ahead facebook has recently gotten serious about marketing its watch video-on-demand platform scrambling to keep pace entertainment companies like disney and warner media have bulked up disney with its 71.3 billion purchase of 21st century fox assets and warner by selling itself to at&t for 85.4 billion and plan to introduce their own megawatt streaming services by the end of the year next to those supertankers viacom is the corporate equivalent of a canoe all of which has agents directors writers and producers confronting uncomfortable questions can paramount the studio that more than any other symbolizes hollywood itself find a path forward as a stand-alone studio or as they did at fox could its end credits roll i knew it was challenged said jim gianopulos a veteran film executive who took over as paramount’s chairman in 2017 and is leading a resuscitation effort i didn’t know how much stroll around the paramount lot as we did one afternoon late last year and you’ll see a frenzy of activity fleets of forklifts carry newly fabricated sets from the in-house woodworking mill gardeners tend the hibiscus hedges electricians hang lights production staffers whiz around on golf carts at a glance paramount seems every bit as vibrant as it was when mr redstone took over in 1994 but the bustle is mostly an illusion few movies are shot in los angeles anymore by paramount or any studio of the 100 top-grossing films in 2017 only 10 were shot in california according to film l.a which tracks production it’s cheaper to make movies in states like new mexico and georgia which offer fat subsidies tv series are still taped on studio lots but mr redstone chopped his business empire into two pieces in 2005 and paramount’s entire small-screen division went to the cbs corporation paramount in many ways has become a glorified rental property hbo leases stage 17 for barry a comedy about a hit man who wants to change professions the weepy this is us a fox production that airs on nbc sprawls across three stages sony and amazon rent other paramount stages the decision to move all of paramount tv really crippled paramount studios said frank j biondi jr who ran viacom from 1987 to 1996 along with filling stages tv production provides studios with a stable revenue stream something to fall back on when big-budget films bomb as some inevitably do tv has also been hollywood’s growth engine over the last decade at least 495 original scripted programs aired in 2018 up from 288 in 2012 the result of new buyers like netflix and hulu to pull paramount back from the brink mr gianopulos and a new lieutenant nicole clemens are rebuilding the studio’s tv operation paramount restarted television production in 2013 and now has nine series running including the alienist on tnt and jack ryan on amazon prime mr gianopulos said he hoped to have 20 series in production by the end of the year viacom said paramount television generated 400 million in revenue last year mr gianopulos said the division’s profit was on track to double this year compared with 2018 with the pressure on her to deliver ms clemens was still zealously working at 6 p.m on a recent friday as we waited outside her office door two assistants dialed phones as if their lives depended on it ms clemens eventually came out from behind her desk oh this is calm she said you should have seen us earlier as important as tv is to paramount’s financial future mr gianopulos said movies would always be the company’s anchor to that end in september 2017 he hired one of hollywood’s top producers wyck godfrey whose resume includes the twilight blockbusters as president of the film division supporting mr godfrey are new marketing publicity and animation chiefs it sounds trite but you are only as good as your team mr gianopulos said and all of the key people that i have brought in are accomplished experienced executives he added of the new hires perhaps commenting indirectly on hotheads who have left the studio none of them are screamers none of them are hyperbolic they’re all grown-ups they’re all collaborative mr godfrey had experienced paramount’s dysfunction firsthand as a producer in 2016 the studio abruptly pulled the plug on one of his projects a movie adaptation of john green’s novel looking for alaska amid a casting dispute from my outsider’s perspective this place had become very fear-based and so my first job was to try and change that mr godfrey said i’ve said to anyone who will listen we are going to start taking real chances on things we believe in i will take the responsibility the heat when we miss which is inevitable but just go for it we have to make more movies and also movies that stand the test of time he continued we have no choice it’s the only way paramount hopes to make 17 movies in 2020 mr godfrey’s coming film lineup emphasizes big-budget global-audience movies known in hollywood as tentpoles a long-gestating top gun sequel is finally happening mr godfrey is working to breathe life into the tired teenage mutant ninja turtles terminator star trek and g.i joe franchises paramount also has high hopes for films tied to viacom’s cable networks including dora the explorer a live-action big-screen adaptation of the nickelodeon cartoon whatever its box-office viability though such fare doesn’t quite scream stand the test of time but mr godfrey insisted otherwise imagine for instance paramount giving star trek to quentin tarantino suddenly people’s eyes light up mr godfrey said yours just did he also pointed out that mission impossible fallout released by paramount in august had proved naysayers wrong that film the sixth chapter in a 23-year-old series received euphoric reviews and generated 791 million in global ticket sales 16 percent more than its franchise predecessor two more mission impossible installments starring tom cruise are moving ahead fallout and another unexpected hit from last spring a quiet place helped paramount post an operating loss of 39 million for 2018 compared with a loss of 280 million a year earlier to compare the industry leading walt disney studios had 2018 profit of 2.98 billion up from 2.36 billion more recent paramount movies have delivered mixed results bumblebee a well-reviewed transformers prequel has taken in roughly 370 million a respectable number if not exactly a breakout hit a pair of fall comedies nobody’s fool and instant family fizzled at the box office mr gianopulos said a turnaround was still early he expects the studio to return to profitability this year in a four-quarter game he said we’re halfway through the second quarter ask hollywood’s power brokers how paramount went from prestige to debris and they will say they don’t want to speak ill of the dead and then they will proceed at length and with great verve to speak ill of the dead mr gianopulos’s predecessor brad grey who led the studio for 12 years resigned under pressure in february 2017 he died from cancer three months later stunning the movie capital almost no one knew he was sick looking back there were signals toward the end of his run mr grey was rarely seen at paramount a rumor took hold calcifying into legend that his chauffeur would drive the car onto the lot and park so it would look as if mr grey were somewhere on the premises and then take a taxi home the studio’s vice chairman rob moore was also frequently away he spent a lot of time in china where he worked on an unconsummated deal to sell a minority stake in the studio he was also dating a chinese tv host an absentee overlord may have contributed to the studio’s decline but the decay can be traced to mr redstone’s battle with mr diller in 1993 mr redstone viewed by hollywood as cocksure and uncouth wanted to acquire paramount to prove that he’d made it that he belonged that he was more than his cable business of vh1 nickelodeon and mtv a media company that the real bigwigs called the house that beavis and butt-head built mr diller also had emotional ties to paramount he had run the studio from 1974 to 1984 finding hits like grease raiders of the lost ark and beverly hills cop but mr diller had visions of using paramount to push hollywood into a new era that a budding information superhighway called the internet might someday run through the studio bringing movies and tv shows directly to computers in other words netflix mr redstone who ended up acquiring blockbuster yes that blockbuster to get the deal done and his lawyers made fun of mr diller’s interest in the internet they ribbed him for bringing a computer one of apple’s early brick laptops into the negotiating room the joke it turned out was on mr redstone whose viacom would miss internet opportunities at nearly every turn over the next 25 years mr diller went on to found iac a thriving collection of web businesses other shortsighted decisions by mr redstone and his cronies rooted in hubris and old-fashioned greed dragged paramount down longtime entertainment executives likened the studio’s mismanagement under mr grey and his boss philippe p dauman who ran viacom from 2006 to 2016 to an old horror movie perhaps invasion of the body snatchers you have this aching sensation in your belly when you see the studio eating itself said jonathan l dolgen chairman of paramount in the 1990s the real debacle started in 2005 to fortify paramount’s slate the studio bought dreamworks skg bringing steven spielberg jeffrey katzenberg and david geffen into the fold but the alliance quickly became a clash of personalities at one point mr dauman told investors that mr spielberg the most powerful director in hollywood then and now was in effect completely immaterial to the company’s earnings mr geffen pried dreamworks loose from paramount and viacom in 2008 then in 2009 a micro-budgeted horror movie called paranormal activity produced by jason blum and released by paramount became a runaway hit spawning a 1 billion franchise instead of anointing mr blum mr grey wanted to control the series and take the credit so he kicked him off the paramount lot mr blum went to universal where he has printed money churning out low-cost blockbusters like get out the purge halloween and split through his blumhouse productions the next year paramount allowed disney to buy out its rights to distribute marvel superhero movies the deal helped viacom executives hit financial targets that triggered bonuses paramount however was hobbled down the road marvel became disney’s most reliable hit machine theories began to spread about how mr grey kept his job early in his tenure he had intervened at a movie premiere party to defend mr dauman from an obscenity-laced fusillade by the producer harvey weinstein back then nobody stood up to mr weinstein and the move endeared mr grey to the refined mr dauman but it had been a setup mr grey had planned the confrontation with mr weinstein whom he had been close to ever since their early careers mr dauman who was fired in 2016 received 72 million in exit payments at the time paramount was losing 450 million a year and viacom’s stock price had fallen 50 percent over two years mr dauman could not be reached for comment for his part mr grey insisted until the end that he had done the best he could with paramount he was proud that mr dauman had allowed him to stick with a romantic notion of the film business one that found a place for auteur-driven movies like silence from martin scorsese and allied by robert zemeckis even as competing studios adjusting to business realities had shifted almost entirely toward fantasy tentpoles hollywood saw paramount as failing to evolve it was almost as if mr grey and certain cohorts were playing out scenes from sunset boulevard which paramount made in 1950 i am big the delusional silent film star norma desmond insists in one famous moment it’s the pictures that got small paramount has endured boom and bust cycles before in the 1960s the studio’s then-owner the industrial conglomerate gulf western very nearly sold a badly struggling paramount for its real estate value talks began with a cemetery that borders the studio more burial plots were envisioned that was when paramount’s young production chief robert evans turned a macabre drama rosemary’s baby into a box office juggernaut another unexpected hit the teary romance love story arrived in 1970 mr evans went on to make the studio a showcase for culture-defining cinema serving up the godfather the godfather ii harold and maude serpico chinatown and urban cowboy among others those movies inspired many of today’s top directors and film executives to pursue hollywood careers an entire generation of creativity reared on what paramount produced a successor sherry lansing kept paramount healthy until handing over the reins to mr grey her tenure was marked by the academy award-winning hits forrest gump braveheart and titanic a co-production with fox the studio was so strong in fact that people in hollywood referred to it by a nickname the mountain a reference to its logo of a snow-capped peak encircled by stars so anything is possible in the months ahead paramount is betting big on drugs gay sex and rock n roll rocketman a musical about elton john’s turbulent life and career arrives from the studio in may one of hollywood’s most competitive months mr gianopulos sees another potential success in ang lee’s gemini man which will roll out in the fall and stars will smith as an aging hit man who must combat a clone of his younger self generally boding well mr gianopulos has repaired crucial relationships with producers hasbro a partner that had grown disenchanted agreed to a five-year extension for instance david ellison a producer and billionaire financier of big-budget movie2021-02-14T20:40:46.894Z - END of articleBody
s like terminator genisys was on the verge of leaving paramount for another studio home base mr gianopulos persuaded him to sign on with paramount for four more years that relationship has once again grown tense however with paramount unhappy about mr ellison’s decision to hire john lasseter who was forced to resign from disney last year amid metoo allegations mr gianopulos in november made a deal with netflix to supply the streaming service with a handful of original movies a year opening up a new revenue stream and paramount finally has the full support of viacom where a new chief executive robert m bakish has put into motion an aggressive turnaround plan in an interview on the 52nd floor of viacom’s times square headquarters mr bakish noted that he had just returned from hollywood where he met with agents telling them that unlike his predecessor he has no plans to offload paramount if anything viacom was doubling down on the studio we are open for business so bring us your scripts it was clear we had a major problem mr bakish said but it’s paramount it’s the mountain movie insiders want to believe that paramount will respond to the heart paddles but some people are privately sitting vigil when we reached mr diller on a business trip in europe to talk about his failed bid for paramount and what has become of the studio and the movie business his first reaction was to ask why anyone would bother writing about the studio why paramount he asked it’s irrelevant

2021-02-14T20:40:47.675Z - articleBody received: seoul south korea a former senior south korean prosecutor was sentenced to two years in prison on wednesday on charges of banishing a junior prosecutor to an obscure posting after she tried to expose his sexual misconduct the case of the former senior prosecutor ahn tae-geun drew particular attention in south korea because the accusations of the junior prosecutor seo ji-hyeon helped fuel a nascent metoo movement in this deeply male-dominated society ms seo recounted during an interview with a cable channel in january 2018 how she had been sexually molested by mr ahn her decision to make public her accusations was an all but unprecedented move in south korea where victims of sexual violence have been afraid to speak out for fear of shame and retaliation ms seo’s action helped encourage a steady stream of women to come forward with accusations of sexual abuse against an array of prominent men including theater directors politicians professors roman catholic priests and a former national speedskating team coach many of the accused men have since apologized for sexual misconduct and resigned from their positions several of them facing criminal charges lee sang-ju a presiding judge at the seoul central district court said in his verdict on wednesday against mr ahn that the former prosecutor had used his influence to cover up his corrupt conduct and discriminated against the victim in job assignments rather than protecting her he inflicted a psychological damage to his victim that is hard to heal the judge added mr ahn who has denied the charges against him said he would appeal the ruling once a rising star among elite prosecutors mr ahn was formally arrested shortly after the ruling on wednesday and was taken to prison his case became a tipping point in south korea’s slowly developing metoo movement after ms seo revealed in online postings and media interviews last year that he had groped her at a funeral in 2010 mr ahn has said he had no recollection of the alleged episode because he was drunk at the time writing in an internal web log for prosecutors ms seo said she had been so deeply traumatized by the abuse that she had a miscarriage but she said that when she lodged a formal complaint and an internal audit began mr ahn used his influence to have her assigned to an obscure posting in a small provincial city mr ahn had headed an office at the justice ministry that supervised job postings of prosecutors before he was forced to resign in 2017 in a corruption scandal ms seo said she had remained silent for years before finally gathering enough courage to speak out when she did she received a wave of public support forcing the justice ministry to open an investigation the ruling on wednesday was a victory for metoo campaigners in south korea their campaign was dealt a significant setback last april when a court acquitted ahn hee-jung a prominent former provincial governor and presidential hopeful of repeatedly raping a female aide the court cited a lack of evidence that mr ahn had coerced his accuser into a sexual relationship

night about what he called the crisis at the southern border he also plans to travel to the border later in the week in an effort to persuade americans of the need for a wall the sticking point in negotiations that caused the partial government shutdown above wall prototypes on the border with tijuana the impact of that shutdown now in its third week has started to ripple across the economy as thousands of secret service and t.s.a agents are expected to show up to work after missing a paycheck but the i.r.s will still issue tax refunds officials said 2 at negotiations about reopening the government on saturday vice president mike pence above insisted on beginning with a prayer so republicans asked god to bring us together on sunday speaker nancy pelosi’s staff members began with another prayer noting that jesus and mary were both refugees the two prayers underscored the stalemate lawmakers find themselves in but some small advances were made white house officials claimed republicans agreed that a concrete wall was a non-starter and that any text of a bill would refer to steel instead here’s what is and isn’t affected by the government shutdown 3 i’m ready to be convinced that’s the mood among iowa democrats who are giddy at the prospect of a packed democratic primary field for 2020 they got their first taste with a stop from elizabeth warren above when the massachusetts senator unofficially kicked off the race over the weekend meanwhile former vice president joseph biden is in the final stages of deciding whether to run for president he’s telling allies

alcohol is the devil’s work and the state should ban it entirely the prohibitionist campaign appeared to be led by supporters of roy moore the republican senate candidate in 2017 who lost to democrat doug jones but it was actually a stealth creation of liberals trying to defeat him the campaign is the second so-called false flag operation by democrats to be discovered in that race and the latest example of how dirty tricks on social media are creeping into american politics 5 five hundred and eighteen inmates sleep in a space for 170 above at manila city jail and gangs keep the order since president rodrigo duterte launched a violent antidrug campaign in 2016 jails in the philippines have become increasingly packed ranking among the most crowded in the world and the overcrowding has gone on for so long and the detainees outnumber the guards by so many that a tacit agreement between officials and jailhouse gangs has become the rule when you are detained in philippine jails you are being tortured said one member of the government’s commission on human rights 6 the stakes were high for rahaf mohammed alqunun above when she slipped away from her family and fled to thailand they

2021-02-14T20:48:47.864Z - articleBody received: a lot of people associate graffiti with covert spray-painting in the dead of night but in the years since teenagers began tagging subway cars and train yards in the bronx in the 1970s a professional marketplace has exploded street artists have produced some of the most recognizable and monetizable images in the world like president barack obama’s 2008 hope campaign poster museums galleries and documentaries have all helped to broaden graffiti artists platform now billion-dollar brands are eager to pay big money for iconic work that’s created career opportunities for artists like faust 34 who has practiced his form of stylized calligraphy in new york city for decades and now has an instagram following of nearly 60,000 faust is a pseudonym born of necessity since he got his start largely by painting other people’s property without permission but it’s stuck even as his work has gained commercial success he also refuses to show his face in photographs today faust earns a living creating art for companies like tiffany’s nike and apple several of his murals are currently on display on the lower east side of manhattan where faust spent much of his time as a child recently he flew to moscow to participate in the biennale artmossphere a russian exposition of street artists from around the world 6 a.m land in moscow in the 1980s and 90s the goal of a new york graffiti artist was to go all city making your name known throughout the five boroughs today for a handful of us the world is our canvas this is my second time visiting moscow in as many years with the current investigation into russian collusion during the 2016 election it feels like a rebellious act just to be here 7:30 a.m check into the azimut hotel smolenskaya i spend the morning tracing my previous visit observing changes to the city largely because of hosting the world cup and keeping an eye out for name-badge stickers i had put up along old arbat street i only spot one it’s rare for graffiti on the streets of moscow to last longer than 24 hours 12 p.m the purpose of my visit is to take part in the artmossphere biennale which features approximately 40 international artists that come from graffiti and street art backgrounds in addition to being a great venue to share your work it’s also an ideal opportunity to meet other artists and curators working in the same vein around the world i join a couple familiar faces for lunch including martha cooper the legendary photographer and co-author of the book subway art which is regarded as the graffiti bible 4 p.m the wall i’m here to paint hasn’t been primed yet it’s 80 degrees and sunny and i’m not going to let the day go to waste i join the co-founder/director of artmossphere at gorky park the central park of moscow where the organization had temporary walls set up for local artists to paint as well as turntables and a platform for a break-dance competition from the perception of moscow in the media i would have never expected this hip-hop youth culture and freedom of expression 7:30 p.m jet lag catches up after dinner i call it an early night 11:30 a.m i make my way to the winzavod contemporary arts center the venue for this year’s artmossphere it’s in a former industrial area that reminds me of urban spree in berlin a bohemian cultural hub in the center of the city my wall is in the main plaza for all to see it’s still yet to be primed and ready to paint i express my concern to the organizers i’ve just arrived and i’m already behind schedule 3 p.m unable to begin my mural i instead join two of the curators of artmossphere on a day of museum-going 11 p.m my wall is finally prepped my concept was solidified in new york and the blueprint of my design was created to fit the wall exactly i work until 1 a.m getting the outline of the letters in place before calling it a night 11 a.m walk to red square passing by the kremlin and st basil’s cathedral then to the new zaryadye park designed by a new york-based architecture firm it’s a totally different design aesthetic than the rest of moscow 1:30 p.m meet with local graffiti artist cozek who i consider to have the best style in moscow his crew aded all day every day has been tapped for a collaboration with the fashion label off-white that’s scheduled to release next week at km20 a fashion-forward shop in town we discuss how artists can leverage working with designer brands to benefit their careers cozek also has a collaboration with a furniture company debuting next week at the cosmoscow art fair and he was hired as the curator for social club a new restaurant and private club opening next week in patriarch ponds he wants to commission me to paint a mural at the restaurant while i’m in town 2:30 p.m cozek gives me a tour of the space the venue is beautifully designed and he invites me to choose any wall i want all of the walls are exposed concrete and if you paint it there’s no going back i seem more concerned about that than he does i’m drawn to a horizontal wall that would be perfect for my work but also recognize i have an 80-foot mural to paint and have my return flight scheduled for the end of the week it would be great real estate as this place will cater to moscow society but i’m reluctant to bite off more than i can chew with my limited time in town 4 p.m cozek and i walk to belief moscow one of the coolest shops in the city i painted a mural in the entryway last year and i’m happy to see that it’s still there the co-owner sergey kub lights up when he sees me as the visit was completely unexpected he’s also preserved another 20-foot mural of mine behind a false wall it reads resistance is patriotic i show him that it’s one of the designs selected by rei kawakubo for my upcoming collaboration with commes des garçons coming out in january 6 p.m i’d planned on putting in a full night of work on the mural but receive an email that there’s a big group dinner for all of the artists and curators afterward when everyone else goes back to the hotel to sleep or keep drinking i go to winzavod to work 2 a.m back at the hotel 12 p.m return to winzavod to work on the mural many of today’s well-known street artists travel with an assistant if not a team to help bring their vision to life some artists are hands-on while others don’t even touch the wall themselves you can call me a perfectionist or perhaps a masochist but i typically travel alone and create my works solely with my own two hands from start to finish which admittedly is not always most efficient i begin filling the letterforms with two to three coats of white until they are solid this part of the process is labor and time-intensive with help from a volunteer the work goes twice as quickly the language barrier keeps our conversation at a minimum 12 a.m sleep 10 a.m after breakfast head to winzavod intent on finishing my mural after all of the letters are filled in i repaint the background with a fresh coat of black cleaning up all of the over-spray and dust that accumulated on the wall over the past few days once that’s done it takes hours to refine the edges of the letters pushing and pulling lines a quarter of an inch making straight lines straighter and freehanding curves that could easily be mistaken for computer vectors 7 p.m i could always keep working on a mural perpetually trying to make it perfect however as the sun sets i pack up my paint put away the ladder and consider this piece finished 11 p.m return to winzavod to meet up with the art director of the atrium a mall in moscow we walked around the building twice looking at potential spots to paint it seems like a great reason to stay another week but i’m not sure what i would do 9 a.m the deputy minister of culture arranged for the guests of artmossphere to take a tour of zaryadye park reluctant to decline the invitation everyone was eager to get back to the winzavod as there’s still much to get done before the opening reception hours away 2 p.m meet with pavel about a mural for the atrium we discuss fabricating the work out of metal to have more presence he also shows me the townhouse a man cave in the mall where artists stay i debate extending my stay for a week to work on social club and atrium commissions 10 a.m move my return flight to next thursday to work on the two new commissions atrium has booked me a nice hotel suite close to their venue their driver picks me up in a mercedes a very different experience than the past week in moscow 1 p.m i spend the afternoon catching up on emails following up with the p.r lead for tiffany’s and signing an n.d.a for apple to hear about a potential project 2:30 p.m google best lunch in moscow it’s my first time having to think about where i’m going to eat since i got here i go for the least expensive option stolovaya 57 in the big mall next to red square soviet-style serve-yourself classic russian food interviews are conducted by email text and phone then condensed and edited

2021-02-14T20:48:47.964Z - articleBody received: los angeles for decades public schools were part of california’s lure key to the promise of opportunity forty years ago with the lightning speed characteristic of the golden state all of that changed in the fall of 1978 after years of bitter battles to desegregate los angeles classrooms 1,000 buses carried more than 40,000 students to new schools within six months the nation’s second-largest school district lost 30,000 students a good chunk of its white enrollment the busing stopped the divisions deepened those racial fault lines had helped fuel the tax revolt that led to proposition 13 the sweeping tax-cut measure that passed overwhelmingly in june 1978 the state lost more than a quarter of its total revenue school districts ability to raise funds was crippled their budgets shrank for the first time since the depression state government assumed control of allocating money to schools which centralized decision-making in sacramento public education in california has never recovered nowhere with more devastating impact than in los angeles where a district now mostly low-income and latino has failed generations of children most in need of help the decades of frustration and impotence have boiled over in a strike with no clear endgame and huge long-term implications the underlying question is can california ever have great public schools again the struggle in los angeles a district so large it educates about 9 percent of all students in the state will resonate around california oakland teachers are on the verge of a strike vote sacramento schools are on the verge of bankruptcy the housing crisis has compounded teacher shortages los angeles like many districts is losing students and therefore dollars even as it faces ballooning costs for underfunded pensions california still ranks low in average per-pupil spending roughly half the amount spent in new york california legislators have already filed bills proposing billions of dollars in additional aid one of many competing pressures that face the new governor gavin newsom as he begins negotiations on his first state budget unlike other states where teachers struck last year california is firmly controlled by democrats for whom organized labor is a key ally and the california teachers unions are among the most powerful lobbying force in sacramento on paper negotiations between the 31,000-member united teachers of los angeles and the los angeles unified school district center on traditional issues salaries that have not kept pace classes of more than 40 students counselors and nurses with staggering caseloads but the most potent and divisive issue is not directly on the bargaining table the future of charter schools which now enroll more than 112,000 students almost one-fifth of all k-through-12 students in the district they take their state aid with them siphoning off 600 million a year from the district the 224 independent charters operate free from many regulations and all but a few are nonunion when california authorized the first charter schools in 1992 as a small experiment no one envisioned that they would grow into an industry now educating 10 percent of public school students in the state to counter demands for greater regulation and transparency charter advocates have in recent years poured millions into political campaigns last year charter school lobbies spent 54 million on losing candidates for governor and state superintendent of education in los angeles they have had more success after his plan to move half of the los angeles district students into charter schools failed to get traction the billionaire and charter school supporter eli broad and a group of allies spent almost 10 million in 2017 to win a majority on the school board the board rammed through the appointment of a superintendent austin beutner with no educational background mr beutner a former investment banker is the seventh in 10 years and has proposed dividing the district into 32 networks a so-called portfolio plan designed in part by the consultant who engineered the radical restructuring of newark schools in my 17 years working with labor unions i have been called on to help settle countless bargaining disputes in mediation wrote vern gates the union-appointed member of the fact-finding panel called in to help mediate the los angeles stalemate last month i have never seen an employer that was intent on its own demise it’s a vicious cycle the more overcrowded and burdened the regular schools the easier for charters to recruit students the more students the district loses the less money and the worse its finances the more the district gives charters space in traditional schools the more overcrowded the regular classrooms enrollment in the los angeles school district has declined consistently for 15 years increasing the competition for students it now educates just under a half-million students more than 80 percent are poor about three-quarters are latino and about one-quarter are english-language learners on most state standardized tests more than one-third fall below standards for 20 years katie safford has taught at ivanhoe elementary a school so atypical and so desirable that it drives up real estate prices in the upscale silver lake neighborhood ivanhoe parents raise almost a half million a year so that their children can have sports arts music and supplies but parents cannot buy smaller classes or a school nurse mrs safford’s second-grade classroom is a rickety bungalow slated for demolition when the floor rotted the district put carpet over the holes when leaks caused mold on the walls mrs safford hung student art to cover stains the clock always reads 4:20 i was born to be a teacher mrs safford said i have no interest in being an activist none but this is ridiculous for the first time in her life she marched last month one of more than 10,000 teachers and supporters in a sea of red monday she walked the picket line outside a school where just eight of the 456 students showed up now her second graders ask the questions no one can answer when will you be back how will it end it is hard to know when the adults have so thoroughly abdicated their responsibility for so long last week the school board directed the superintendent to draw up a plan examining ways to raise new revenue this strike comes at a pivotal moment for california schools amid recent glimmers of hope demographic shifts have realigned those who vote with those who rely on public services like schools voters approved state tax increases to support education in 2012 and again in 2016 in the most recent election 95 of 112 school bond issues passed a total of over 15 billion the revised state formula drives more money into districts with more low-income students and english learners total state school aid increased by 23 billion over the past five years and governor newsom has proposed another increase if los angeles teachers can build on those gains the victory will embolden others to push for more just as teachers on the rainy picket lines this week draw inspiration from the successful redfored movements around the country the high stakes have drawn support from so many quarters from the rev james lawson the 90-year-old civil rights icon to a tacos for teachers campaign to fund food on the picket lines if this fight for public education in los angeles fails it will consign the luster of california schools to an ever more distant memory

2021-02-14T20:48:48.617Z - articleBody received: washington william p barr president trump’s nominee for attorney general assured senators at his confirmation hearing on tuesday that he would permit the special counsel robert s mueller iii to complete the russia investigation and said he was determined to resist any pressure from mr trump to use law enforcement for political purposes mr barr whose confirmation seems virtually assured pointed to his age and background he served as attorney general from 1991 to 1993 as buffers to potential intrusions on the justice department’s traditional independence he suggested he had no further political aspirations that might cloud his judgment the way that future ambitions might give pause to a younger nominee as well as the experience to fight political interference i am in a position in life where i can provide the leadership necessary to protect the independence and reputation of the department mr barr 68 told the senate judiciary committee adding that he would not hesitate to resign if mr trump pushed him to act improperly i will not be bullied into doing anything i think is wrong by anybody whether it be editorial boards or congress or the president mr barr said i’m going to do what i think is right he also pledged that he would refuse any order from mr trump either to fire mr mueller without good cause in violation of regulations or to rescind those rules first it is in the best interest of everyone the president congress and most importantly the american people that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work mr barr said mr barr’s first stint as attorney general came under president george bush who was known for his prudent and measured approach if confirmed mr barr would serve under a president hardly known for self-restraint mr trump repeatedly excoriated jeff sessions the former attorney general for recusing himself from the russia investigation which mr trump has called a witch hunt and pushed him to open criminal investigations into political adversaries like hillary clinton president trump says he alone can do it his attorney general nominee usually agrees over hours of testimony mr barr displayed a grasp of policy and demonstrated his experience as a washington hand and member of the republican legal establishment he is expected to be confirmed both because republicans control the senate and because democrats are deeply suspicious of matthew g whitaker the acting attorney general whom mr trump installed after ousting mr sessions in november mr barr is qualified by any reasonable standard senator lindsey graham republican of south carolina and the committee’s chairman said after the hearing adding that he saw no reason to doubt mr barr would be confirmed and if he’s not qualified i don’t know who they are ever going to pick during his testimony mr barr described being asked whether he was interested in joining mr trump’s defense team in june 2017 by a friend of the president’s although mr barr agreed to meet with mr trump and told him he said that mr mueller was both a personal friend and a straight shooter who should be dealt with as such he declined to join his legal team my wife and i were sort of looking forward to a bit of respite and i didn’t want to stick my head into that meat grinder mr barr said asked by senator richard j durbin democrat of illinois why as a rational person he would want the job after seeing mr trump’s unrelenting criticism of mr sessions mr barr portrayed himself as an institutionalist because i love the department and all its components including the f.b.i mr barr said i think they are critical institutions that are essential to preserving the rule of law which is the heartbeat of this country mr barr’s testimony also touched on many other issues regarding mr trump’s demand for funding for a border wall which has prompted the longest government shutdown in american history mr barr expressed qualified support for expanding barriers along the border with mexico where they could be part of common sense immigration enforcement but he sidestepped questions about whether mr trump could lawfully redirect military funds to build a wall without congressional authorization as the president has threatened to invoke emergency powers to do asked by senator dianne feinstein democrat of california about remarks he made in 2005 defending the george w bush administration’s enhanced interrogation techniques program and the idea that it was lawful to use pain discomfort and other things to make people talk so long as it does not cross the line to torture mr barr said he would obey and uphold a 2015 law restricting american interrogators to using only those techniques listed in the army field manual transcript sen hirono are you concerned having written about morality and consensus in our society are you concerned about the way donald trump undermines the institutions in our society that help us to maintain a moral consensus barr no senator and i’d like to make a point about the witch hunt which is we have to remember that the president is the one that has denied that there was any collusion and has been steadfast in that so presumably he knows facts i don’t know facts i don’t think anyone here knows facts but i think it’s understandable that if someone felt they were falsely accused they would view an investigation as something like a witch hunt where someone like you or me who doesn’t know the facts you know might not use that term well you you’re certainly coming to his defense as i said it’s been objectively verified that he lies on a regular basis under questioning about whether he had sought to push out the deputy attorney general rod j rosenstein who is widely expected to leave if mr barr is confirmed the nominee said he had not and indeed had asked mr rosenstein to stay on longer for a transition period and he assured senators from both parties that his views on the criminal justice system had evolved from the early 1990s when he advocated stiffer sentences for drug offenders and that he would fully carry out substantial sentencing and prison law changes passed last month but the hearing repeatedly returned to russia’s attempts to manipulate the american election process and the open investigation by mr mueller into moscow’s campaign of subversion and possible links to mr trump and his associates early in the hearing mr graham brought up the f.b.i.’s newly revealed counterintelligence investigation into whether the president was working with the russians asking incredulously whether mr barr had heard of such a thing in all the time you have been associated with the department when mr barr answered that he had not mr graham sought and obtained mr barr’s assurance that he would look into who opened the investigation into the president at the f.b.i or the justice department and to tell the committee whether it was appropriate later mr barr also defended as entirely proper his decision to write an unsolicited lengthy memo to the trump administration legal team in june arguing that laws against obstruction of justice cannot criminalize a president’s use of his constitutional powers like when mr trump fired james b comey as f.b.i director insisting he had not been not trying to ingratiate himself with the trump administration by writing the memo mr barr played it down as based on mere speculation about the basis for mr mueller’s obstruction inquiry he said that he believed that other potential actions by a president like witness tampering would be a legitimate basis for an obstruction investigation in any case mr barr repeatedly said he would let mr mueller whom he described as a friend of his for decades finish his work and dismissed mr trump’s attacks on the inquiry i don’t believe mr mueller would be involved in a witch hunt mr barr said but in another moment he called mr trump’s use of that term understandable and refused to criticize the president’s attacks on mr mueller and the justice department mr barr also appeared to emphasize a softer vision of presidential power than the unusually expansive view he has largely advanced throughout his career for example previously portraying the president instead of the attorney general as the nation’s top law-enforcement official who wields unfettered power to start or stop a law enforcement proceeding his philosophy on executive authority has raised the question of whether his permissive theories would unleash mr trump but in several ways on tuesday mr barr appeared to walk back or qualify some of his earlier writings putting greater emphasis on the justice department’s independence and legal limits on the presidency for example mr barr said that if a president directed the department to close an investigation to protect himself or his family that would violate the constitution and asked by senator patrick j leahy democrat of vermont whether a president could pardon someone in exchange for a promise not to incriminate him mr barr said that would be a crime he also pledged to seek the advice of ethics lawyers in the justice department about whether he should recuse himself from overseeing the russia inquiry while stopping short of committing to accepting their recommendation late last year justice department ethics officials recommended to mr whitaker that he recuse himself from overseeing that investigation but mr whitaker declined to do so separately representative jerrold nadler democrat of new york and the chairman of the house judiciary committee announced in a letter on tuesday that mr whitaker had agreed to testify publicly before his committee on feb 8 regardless of the status of the border wall impasse or whether or not the senate has confirmed a new attorney general the hearing promises to be a blockbuster session and should turn on many of the same questions mr barr faced including about mr mueller the fate of mr mueller’s findings an expected report was a recurring topic mr barr said that mr mueller’s report to the attorney general would be confidential but that the attorney general would then produce his own report to congress based on that material he said that he intended to be as transparent as possible given grand jury secrecy rules but that he would not let the white house edit or change it as the president’s lawyer rudolph w giuliani had suggested might occur that will not happen mr barr said

2021-02-14T20:50:01.787Z - articleBody received: there was a time a few years ago when i would refer my new psychotherapy clients to a video clip of an appearance by the comedian louis c.k on conan o’brien’s talk show what begins as a funny bit about why louis c.k thinks cellphones are bad for teenagers turns into a thoughtful rumination on the way we use cellphones to avoid dealing with pain in life which becomes a touching plea for feeling our feelings you’re lucky to live sad moments he says after recounting a powerful experience of loneliness in his own life i was grateful to feel sad and then i met it with true profound happiness so many of my new clients arrive at my office feeling numb depleted and anxious they are afraid to touch the big feelings that lie underneath sharing louis c.k.’s riff on emotions and anxiety was a playful way to reassure them it’s o.k we all struggle with this stuff and there truly is something rewarding at the end of this work i don’t share that louis c.k clip anymore not since november 2017 when five female comedians publicly described inappropriate behavior by him including occasions on which he masturbated in front of them stories that he confirmed i didn’t stop sharing the video just because of what he did i also stopped because of how he handled the fallout from these revelations his initial apology was rushed and sloppy and did not fully own up to all of his behavior though he did vow to step back and take a long time to listen instead he ducked out of the public eye for about 10 months only to reappear on stage without much in the way of discussion about his absence save for how bad this ordeal was for him and how much money he lost in a long island comedy club last month he seemed to go out of his way to be offensive and bullying even mocking survivors of the school shooting in parkland fla he left the public eye in 2017 promising to listen but has returned having learned seemingly nothing the great disappointment for those of us who were fans of louis c.k.’s work is how strongly his behavior cuts against our original sense of him this was a man who seemed able to connect deeply and authentically with his own messy experiences and in doing so he invited us to embrace our own messy realities was it all an act some might answer yes that we now know who the real louis c.k is but i am holding out hope for something better from him as a psychotherapist i often see men and women at their worst so i know that a person who harms himself or who has harmed someone else is not defined only by that behavior that truth is demonstrated by his presence in my office i get to witness the drive for healing and repair alongside a patient’s suffering many of my clients are men who have hurt women cheating or assaultive husbands bullies abusive co-workers these men often come to therapy first to make sense of the hurt they have caused other people hurt that is often a consequence of wounds they themselves carry yet they often make every effort to steer the topic to anything else even when we discuss it they protect themselves by minimizing it was just one time and i was drunk obscuring back when all of that drama happened and placing the blame elsewhere everyone is out to get me they’re afraid to fully face their wrongdoing not just the repercussions but also the deep shame they would feel in acknowledging the truth i struggle with how to work with men like this in spite of their actions i often find them likable paradoxically i would not be able to work with them if i didn’t like and care about them it is always tempting to give in to that impulse to absolve them of their guilt to reassure them that they are still good men in spite of what they have done but that would be morally unconscionable and more important it would not bring them healing real healing emerges only when i accompany them to whatever dark place it is that they have worked so hard to avoid there is always a moment where this comes to the forefront where a patient’s casual-seeming phrase becomes an opportunity to explore his avoidance of painful realities do you notice i might say how you keep focusing on how angry your wife is with you could we take some time to sit with how you feel toward yourself or what if instead of i only lash out when i’m drunk you say it again but this time as i lashed out at my wife last night my clients are often surprised by this but they come to understand what i mean speaking to your real experience is the only way for your true feelings to emerge and when they do something changes inevitably anger at themselves emerges i feel sick they might say or i’d like to knock some sense into myself in those moments i feel relieved to see their conscience re-emerge and i make it a point to share my relief with them it would be much more disturbing to me i might say if you didn’t feel that way many feelings come up in these moments but almost always anger gives way relief sometimes in the form of tears sometimes as just a sense of calm permission to feel angry and disgusted with our actions is reassuring and mobilizing these moments allow my clients to begin to do the work of truly understanding themselves so that they can be the men they want to be and start to make amends which leads me back to my disappointment with louis c.k.’s return to the stage if he’s changed at all he seems to have transformed into an online troll intent on shocking and provoking the sort of courage and honest self-reflection that my clients draw on for their healing is what i admired about louis c.k.’s best work it embraced uncomfortable feelings and uncomfortable realities he demanded that we get to know our true selves better now he just wants a cheap laugh at someone else’s expense imagine what louis c.k could do with his failings if he tackled them head-on i’m not talking about a fairy-tale ending he will always have to live with his shame the women he mistreated will always have to live with what he took from them but he could give us a singular gift by helping us engage with why men take advantage of women in this way and why they double down to avoid blame and responsibility louis c.k was right when he said that gratitude and joy follow sadness and in the same way relief honor and a sense of purpose follow facing ourselves and our actions details have been altered to protect patient privacy avi klein is a psychotherapist follow the new york times opinion section on facebook twitter nytopinion and instagram

2021-02-14T20:50:01.993Z - articleBody received: saturday puzzle this is grant thackray’s third grid for us and i continue to appreciate his quirkiness and extremely skillful integration of natural-sounding long entries we didn’t have full stacks today nor did we have much more than a sprinkle of unadulterated fill the middle ground comprised a respectable helping of tricky words and phrases a few of them were risky yes but by the end of my solve i was much more amused in the aggregate than at all aggravated so i did shake my fist a few times in the general direction of the vengeful crossword gods up and to the right if you were wondering mainly this was because i had all these fabulous guesses that were just a letter too long or too short so many that i wondered if there could be a trick today world records funnel cake and pitchers are a few examples of what i’m talking about on the other hand a lot of the clues that stumped me entirely turned out to be edifying which as you know is a major raison d’être for my solving puzzles at all some of you like to rush which is just fine but if i find myself looking up entries for the column and getting happily absorbed i consider those extra minutes solving to be time well spent 2a is a great example of this scheherezade was my first thought for this clue but her name was much too short genie started to emerge and then came lamp but genie of the lamp just wasn’t familiar once i had the crosses perhaps this is an old cultural reference that i should have known since childhood but when i googled it i got this wonderful robin williams performance that i’d never seen before 19a the answer to this clue completely sneaked up on me it makes perfect sense but my mind still went from kebab which i do not eat vertically but something about a spit or a skewer struck me as reasonable here to roast for some reason as more letters filled in proper toast pops up from a real toaster before it lays down gets buttered and dolloped with some apricot jam then usually slides off its plate and lands good side down in my house which is physics 31a funnel cake which is flattish and fried gets its name from the funnel used in its preparation to avoid splattering hot oil everywhere i still went there when i saw this clue after discarding doughnut and before coming to bundt cake i’ve really only thought of the similarly named cake pan which i use for a lemon angel food cake that collapses neurotically when otherwise constrained but doing some cursory research i think that we might get away with calling any cake we bake in a bundt pan a bundt cake 32a i got this on crosses and once band name appeared my sensitive self cringed a little bit it’s a me mario but it’s of an era the mario bros games movies lunchboxes toys pajamas and whatever else you can think of go all the way back to the early 1980s and it’s surprisingly hard to find much pushback online to the character’s broadness this expression introduced mario at the beginning of each game so it’s probably etched into some solvers brains not mine the guy behind the voice is pretty unique 14d i know enough about romance languages in general to get this entry primus but it still instantly reminded me of this really weird band whose fans somehow constantly enter my life for that reason probably i thought of band name right away at 31d 22d is this what we’d call double meta i thought workers making preparations to retire was such a clever hint for pitchers who make their bacon from retiring batters in baseball i was wrong the real answer plays on the same word with an even better pun a pit crew earns its collective keep by retiring racecars i.e changing tires out for fresher tires in less than 12 seconds 40d i really adored this entry which was utterly mystifying for a good long moment before the aha happened my paltry mixology knowledge didn’t include sidecar at all except as a possible other meaning to chaser a little drink next to your main drink made sense to me to be honest i think my mixology knowledge begins and ends with the 1988 tom cruise movie cocktail which is why alabama slammer gave me no trouble at all i solved bar tab on the crosses but figured i’d find out more about this sidecar and apparently the name does refer to an actual motorcycle sidecar in the drink’s origin story which of course is contested the drink actually sounds pretty nice a combination of cognac cointreau and lemon served in a sugared coupe or stemmed glass with a rounded bowl when my last puzzle was published i went onto the comments section of the wordplay blog as i’m sure many new constructors do i was pleasantly surprised at the positive responses from people despite a few minor nitpicks most people loved it however there was one woman who really seemed to hate my puzzle with a fiery passion she insulted me directly saying she had been doing the nyt puzzle for 60 or so years and was disgusted by what it had turned out to be she slammed my use of you know it or you don’t clues implying i wasn’t man enough to include clues based solely on wordplay alone my response to her is i’m sorry my puzzle made you feel that way i genuinely am despite all that i’m still proud of it i believe that the new york times crossword exists as a reflection of the english language of how people speak in this day and age i’m sorry if you wish there were more scholarly clues and words with only dictionary definitions but people in real life use slang and they talk about movies and they use brand names the crossword is a reflection of the world as it is and it’s always used clues that you either know or you don’t i don’t know the names of obscure czech composers or minor characters from leave it to beaver but i’m happy to find things i don’t know and learn them so you don’t have to do my puzzle today because yes there’s another video game reference in it there are plenty of old puzzle compilation books from decades past that are still good but if you’re willing to give this puzzle a try maybe you’ll learn something about the things in my world i am very proud of today’s puzzle it’s seemingly become a good-luck charm of mine to put a video game clue in my puzzles like the classic 32-across how can you not say it in his voice i’m also proud of the pun clues sprinkled throughout and the inclusion of what i think is the funniest food 31-across i don’t know why basically i made the grid and the first thing my program suggested was that center circle in its entirety i was astounded at how easy it was and i just went from there subscribers can take a peek at the answer key trying to get back to the puzzle page right here what did you think

punishing mix of heavy snow strong winds and frigid temperatures in kansas officials dispensed warnings to ranchers about how to keep their horses from freezing to death small towns notified residents that their plows might not keep up with the rapid snowfall leaving streets impassable and in a foretaste of the chaos likely to ensnarl the country’s transportation networks hundreds of flights were canceled at chicago’s o’hare international airport before a single snowflake had fallen there the storm was also expected to further strain the national weather service where many employees have been furloughed as part of the partial government shutdown others including those putting out the storm warnings that state and local officials rely on for their planning are considered essential and are working without pay i’ve been working for the national weather service for over 27 years i’ve never seen the morale as low as it is right now said dan sobien the president of the national weather service employees organization he said that the job of making forecasts in a major storm was inherently stressful and would be doubly so at a time when employees were also worrying about how to pay basic expenses like rent and child care we’re human beings he said the weather system has already deluged the west causing power losses flooding mudslides and deaths about 80 million people from the dakotas to maine were under some form of winter weather advisory and meteorologists warned against driving during the height of the storm where you show up saturday night you should plan on staying there until monday morning derek schroeter a meteorologist at the national weather service office in gray me advised people in the northeast think snowstorms are rough now check out these vintage photos of new york blizzards in the rockies and the plains some schools were closed on friday the national weather service in boulder colo said that avalanche danger was high in some parts of the rocky mountains with winds up to 40 miles an hour in places above timberline already the storm has caused a truck to plunge off the colorado’s main east-west highway near vail spilling wooden crates onto the wet ground and prompting the colorado state patrol to send a cleanup crew into the slushy mess and the authorities closed the airport in omaha neb after a southwest airlines plane slid off an icy runway the associated press reported in aberdeen s.d where temperatures dropped to three degrees by midday friday hassan yusuf a manager at banadir kitchen an east african restaurant said he had not opened for lunch because he figured no one would come in our customers stay home on days like this said mr yusuf who is originally from somalia i don’t want to be outside either when i shovel the snow i feel the pain in my fingers as the storm sweeps east and then north des moines was forecast to get eight inches of snow youngstown ohio 10 inches allentown pa eight inches and bennington vt 19 inches mr schroeter of the national weather service said the area he covers new hampshire and western maine could get 12 to 18 inches of snow with the heaviest snowfall early sunday morning the storm will be followed by numbing temperatures 15 to 25 degrees below normal across the plains and the upper midwest some areas near albany n.y were predicted to have low temperatures between minus 10 and minus 20 the concern would be if you do lose power the cold’s going to be pretty significant sunday night and monday mr schroeter said adding that he was not expecting major power failures in his area because the snow was unlikely to be wet and heavy enough to bring down trees states of emergencies were declared in new jersey and pennsylvania gov tom wolf of pennsylvania also banned commercial vehicles from some highways between noon saturday and noon sunday and reduced speed limits to 45 miles per hour on interstates and expressways in wellsboro pa about two hours drive northeast of state college the borough manager scot boyce jr said it was likely to be the biggest storm he had handled in his not-quite two years on the job with between 12 and 18 inches of snow predicted he used the police department’s facebook page to warn wellsboro’s 3,300 residents that at some point the borough’s eight plow drivers would probably not be able to keep up with the snow accumulation by the looks of what we’re going to get we’re probably going to pull the plows right off the streets after a while in order to save gas and give the drivers time to sleep mr boyce said but in at least one place

2021-02-14T20:50:02.101Z - articleBody received: wellington new zealand when new zealand’s housing crisis became so bad that one study found only hong kong less affordable the country’s prime minister came up with a solution an ambitious plan to prompt the construction of 100,000 new homes over the next decade to help ease prices but on wednesday the government of prime minister jacinda ardern said it would scrap its initial targets after failing to meet them with just 47 of the 1,000 homes it had promised by july built so far those numbers suggest that an answer to the worsening shortage is still years away and the acknowledgment came as a new study showed that housing had grown more unaffordable around the country with property priced further out of reach than in the united states britain and australia that study the annual demographia international report compared median house prices with median income in cities in seven wealthy countries and in hong kong data from the third quarter of 2018 suggested that only hong kong was less affordable than new zealand where the country’s median house price was 6.5 times the median income up from 5.8 in the same period a year earlier hugh pavletich one of the report’s authors said housing had become more affordable in australia over the past year as prices fell amid tightening credit he said that ms ardern’s government which took office in october 2017 had been messing around by focusing too much on the hotly debated plan to build 100,000 more houses called kiwibuild instead of freeing up more land for construction which he said could have kept prices in check if they’d got out of the starting blocks with structural reforms centered around land supply and infrastructure financing soon after the election it would have sent a far clearer signal to the market and subdued it significantly as these changes were put in place he said but the center-left labour party that ms ardern leads has now conceded that its flagship policy will not ease the housing crisis as rapidly as it had hoped the prime minister told reporters wednesday that the government would still build 100,000 housing units in a decade but that its interim targets would be scrapped the government now expects to have 300 new homes built under the plan by july rather than the original plan for 1,000 phil twyford the housing minister said wednesday that there would be a recalibration of the policy noting that demand for the new homes in some areas had been weaker than expected kiwibuild has faced criticism from political opponents that even its cheapest houses are too expensive for first-time buyers who had been shut out of the market no government in the last 40 years has seriously tried what we are trying to do mr twyford told reporters and that’s change a failed market he said in separate emailed comments on thursday that the government was also setting up new ways to finance infrastructure for housing while loosening planning rules we have built 1,000 new state houses since we came to office mr twyford said referring to public housing separate from the kiwibuild initiative adding that the government had put 1,800 families into those homes there are more than 11,600 people and families on public housing waiting lists according to government figures shamubeel eaqub a housing economist with the consultancy sense partners in auckland new zealand’s largest city said he was not surprised that the construction industry and buyers had not warmed to the kiwibuild program neither the building nor purchasing of kiwibuild houses is subsidized by the government which only acts as a guarantor to facilitate the building of affordable properties it also decides who can buy such units to ensure they go to first-time home buyers who earn less than the designated income cap the government is telling builders to use exactly the same processes we have in place now but build cheaper houses mr eaqub said that’s why you’ve seen very few builders participate he added that new zealand’s housing shortage had worsened because construction was a cottage industry that had not grown to meet demand and had not focused on the kind of tract building common in other parts of the world the country is half a million housing units short of demand he said and because successive new zealand governments had not been involved in homebuilding for decades inexperience had led ms ardern’s party to misjudge their targets the labour party took power after nine years of center-right government with a promise to tackle affordable housing after a national outcry ignited by news reports about homelessness and families living in their cars particularly in auckland but the latest demographia figures show the problem has spread all of new zealand’s major cities were rated as seriously or severely unaffordable with a house in the least expensive city palmerston north priced at five times the median income mr pavletich one of the report’s authors said smaller markets like tauranga a coastal city on the north island with a population of 128,000 had seen an influx of people who had left auckland in search of more affordable housing average property values in tauranga had risen to 497,000 from 304,000 in the last five years and demographia now rated it among the 10 least affordable cities in the world along with famously expensive locales such as hong kong san francisco sydney and vancouver british columbia mr eaqub the housing economist said the scale of the problem was such that it would take decades to fix regardless of whether the government could accelerate kiwibuild it’s not something that can be affected quickly he said of the housing crunch we’re just really short of houses

2021-02-14T20:50:02.251Z - articleBody received: hamlet is in a bathtub with water up to his neck delivering to be or not to be look to your right and you’ll see his mother gertrude in her bedroom putting on makeup look in the distance and you’ll see laertes practicing with his sword and if you look to your left you will see your own reflection in a gilded mirror you will appear haggard bloody ferocious and in fact dead because in this virtual reality version of shakespeare you are the ghost of hamlet’s murdered father that version hamlet 360 thy father’s spirit is a joint production of two very different outfits commonwealth shakespeare company which is known for staging free shakespeare on boston common and the tech giant google its creators hope that beyond the fresh experience it provides it will also serve as a tool to bring great theater to wider audiences and bring bigger audiences to theater this allows us to scale up our mission on the boston common said steven maler the director of the film and the founding artistic director of the commonwealth shakespeare company this allows us to scale that mission to the world and truly democratize shakespeare and theater other theater productions have played with new and immersive technologies in recent years the national theater in london and the national film board canada produced draw me close a memoir which uses virtual reality and motion capture to bring the audience into a character’s memories a one-man show called the encounter handed out earphones and used sound in a way that was central to the storytelling characters seemed suddenly to be right beside you the royal shakespeare company mounted a production of the tempest that used motion capture to create an onstage digital avatar of the spirit ariel hamlet 360 was released friday by wgbh a pbs member station in boston it will be hosted on the station’s youtube page where it can be watched in 3-d using a v.r headset or in two dimensions on a desktop or mobile device the budget for the film was roughly similar to what the commonwealth shakespeare company spends each year on its boston common productions which is about 500,000 mr maler declined to say how much was paid by google at just 61 minutes this hamlet is both extremely long by the standards of virtual reality and extremely short by the standards of hamlet mr maler said that in order to mercilessly slice it down while also creating a satisfying story he laser-focused on hamlet’s relationship with his father the film plays out in a single location at the center of a large run-down hall with a stage to one side it is a cavernous room outfitted with lamps a collection of shabby and ornate furniture a patchwork of rugs and an old car actors moves around the room encouraging viewers to explore the space sometimes a sound that seems to come from over your shoulder is a prompt to turn around matt apfel the director of augmented reality and virtual reality content at google said there was a sizable void when it came to arts and culture and v.r so when mr maler who does consulting for google pitched the idea mr apfel and his team were intrigued the possibilities of using hamlet 360 as an educational tool were also exciting mr maler said one of his central goals for the project was to bring this hamlet into classrooms and schools where performances of shakespeare are common but professional-caliber productions are not many young people’s first experience of shakespeare is not all that great he said this is a way to put into the classroom an extraordinary experience of this play and give teachers another tool to bring the material to life although you watch it on a screen hamlet 360 feels in many ways more like theater than cinema the takes for example are extremely long the get thee to a nunnery scene lasts nearly 10 minutes and is composed of only two shots matthew niederhauser a technical director and cinematographer on the project said that quick takes can be hard to watch in v.r because viewers have to reorient themselves every time the camera moves to capture the action a camera called the yi halo 360 lent by google was planted in one spot and the actors moved around it aiming for the sweet spot of its focal depth about three to eight feet away the halo is made up of 17 cameras one pointed up and the rest fanned around in the shape of a wreath the resolution can be a little grainy but the production was shot so that as viewing technology improves this hamlet will keep up with the times mr niederhauser said with lenses pointed in every direction except down there is a blind spot on the floor obscured by whiffs of smoke used to signify the ghost’s presence crew members couldn’t just shuffle behind the camera when action was called there was a black wall in the back of the hall where most of the crew would stand the sound engineer sometimes hid behind pieces of scenery like a big sofa or a car we run away and hide mr niederhauser said and then action is called quirky technical requirements also created unusual challenges for the actors mr maler said he intentionally cast a group with stage and camera experience including jay o sanders in the role of hamlet’s father brooke adams as queen gertrude and faran tahir as king claudius i don’t want to make it sound harder than it was but it kind of had the hardest parts of both said jack cutmore-scott the actor who plays hamlet referring to the camera and stage work we were working with very long scenes he said adding and once you’re in a scene everything has to go right because if anything goes wrong you have to start again mr cutmore-scott said that seeing his own performance in 3-d was also a somewhat different experience it’s always fairly horrible watching yourself onscreen he said this was quite strange because it feels very much like you’re in the room with everybody and when everybody is yourself it’s doubly weird indeed being right there in the room is what gives this project so much potential mr maler said because it changes the experience of a story that has been told for 400 years during the play-within-the-play when gertrude and claudius watch as the murder of hamlet’s father is effectively re-enacted onstage you are right next to them in the audience watching claudius squirm watching hamlet seethe all while watching the play yourself it is surprisingly easy to get lost in what surrounds you even with a headset perched on your face this is a tool that can help us as theater practitioners open up the tent again mr maler said a way he added to show people how exciting it can be to be in the space where it’s happening but if this technology can give people the experience of a front-row seat will it replace live theater altogether mr maler does not think so i feel like we’re at one of those inflection points like when photography came on board and people thought oh my god painting is dead he said obviously both mediums are thriving

of dark moon a top 20 country single on the dot label that crossed over to the pop top 10 in 1957 the record a haunting nocturne sung in a clear-toned alto was along with patsy cline’s walkin after

version by gale storm earned ms guitar an invitation to appear on the ed sullivan show in june 1957 later that year she performed mister fire eyes her successful follow-up to dark moon on the tv show american bandstand but the achievement for which ms guitar never really received her due perhaps because she decided to remain in her native washington instead of resettling in a major recording center like los angeles or nashville was her trailblazing work as a studio maven and entrepreneur over seven decades she did everything from engineer recordings to scout talent and run a record label

tech she’s using you write about chinese tech what tech tools do you rely on to do your job and what do you like about them it’s not an exaggeration to say i live in and work on wechat the messaging app that’s the equivalent of whatsapp plus facebook plus paypal plus uber plus grubhub plus many other things as my iphone battery use record shows i spend about one-third of my daily nine-hour phone time on wechat that doesn’t include the two to three hours i use wechat’s web version i’m not alone in my heavy wechat use there are 800 million internet users in china but over one billion wechat accounts just about every chinese online has at least one account and some more than one over one-third of them spend four hours or more on the app each day the prevalence has made wechat an indispensable part of many people’s lives and work two years ago i met two people who refused to use wechat and i thought about writing a story about how people like them navigated work and life before i got around to it both became my wechat friends so as a journalist i have to hang out on wechat i message and call my sources on wechat i keep an eye on wechat moment which is similar to facebook timeline and group chats so i’ll always be on top of what’s going on in china when others pretend they are too busy to get back to me i comment on their moment posts and group chats to tell them that i know they aren’t so busy by now some readers must be screaming how about the censorship and government surveillance on wechat sadly it’s just the way of life in china i’m not trying to make light of the issue i’ve been very critical of how the tech companies work with the government to censor and monitor the chinese public but the reality is that ordinary chinese often feel powerless and fatalistic when it comes to censorship and surveillance i’ve tried to persuade people to get on encrypted messaging apps such as signal and whatsapp but haven’t had much success i also use weibo the chinese equivalent of twitter i used to be an active weibo user and still have a few million followers there but after the government cracked down on weibo a few years ago and shut down many of the most provocative and influential accounts i don’t use it too often because the conversations are often dominated by celebrity news instead of discussions of current affairs but weibo is still a good place to check out the hottest topics and trends that’s where i found people to talk to for a column i wrote about the generation that grew up without google facebook or twitter how do people in china use tech differently compared with people in the united states the first thing many visitors to china notice is how mobile the chinese are many chinese never owned a laptop or a pc and their first computer was their smartphone email never really took off in china some big corporations do use it but people usually resort to wechat for a quick response because of wechat’s prevalence few chinese carry business cards any more at many meetings in china there’s a time when everybody takes out his or her phone and scans the wechat qr codes of others to become friends i personally like having contacts on wechat rather than on business cards because it’s a social media platform you learn about your contacts as individuals beyond their business titles many businesspeople i know have two or more wechat accounts because wechat allows only 5,000 contacts for one account a young venture capitalist told me that it had taken him only two years to reach the limit i don’t know how they manage so many contacts generally chinese are more receptive to new things and more tolerant of imperfect products including mobile apps some commentators here say facebook is almost a chinese company because of its move fast and break things mantra many people in china’s internet industry work super-long hours to make sure they beat competitors to roll out new features first why are mobile wallets so popular in china when i moved from new york to beijing in 2008 china was still a cash-based nation not many people had credit cards and it wasn’t easy for small businesses to get approval to install the machines i used to have to go to the a.t.m.s all the time going to the banks mostly giant state-owned enterprises was torturously time-consuming then came wechat pay and alipay the mobile payment services from tencent and alibaba since so many chinese were already on wechat and were trained to scan qr codes it took the two giants only some cash-bonus campaigns at grocery stores to convert people like my mom to mobile payments mobile pay is now available in almost every place i visit in china including small towns i’ve been carrying a 100-yuan 15 bill in my wallet for months but haven’t found an occasion to use it everybody hotels department stores taxi drivers noodle stands takes alipay or wechat pay or both even tollbooths accept mobile payment what are some hot new apps tech products or internet services in china the hottest app is a short video service douyin which is called tiktok outside china as my colleague kevin roose aptly put it in a recent column it’s a quirky hybrid of snapchat the defunct video app vine and the tv segment carpool karaoke to be honest i’m too old for the app douyin targets urban teenagers and 20-somethings and have not spent much time on it but i’ve seen some viral douyin videos on weibo and wechat that are fun and goofy some young chinese told me that they spend hours watching douyin videos every day which i would argue is the downside of the app its parent company bytedance is very good at using artificial intelligence to push content based on users viewing history the short video app that i check out from time to time is douyin’s rival kwai kwai is popular in small towns and the countryside you can watch young people chasing geese and getting married in white gowns in front of mud houses i call kwai the hillbilly elegy of china it’s where you can get a flavor of what china is like outside the biggest coastal cities outside of work what tech product are you into right now i’m a very low-tech person while my iphone feels like an extension of my left arm i don’t use many other electronics i didn’t own a tv until a year ago and only watch netflix sometimes i bought a microwave this year and it’s the simplest model because i knew i would use it only to reheat food my biggest tech wish is for google facebook apple or another company to build a technology that can break the great firewall the system of filters and blocks that prevents chinese from visiting thousands of foreign websites instead of kowtowing to the chinese government’s demands in order to gain access to the market american tech giants could do something heroic liberate hundreds of millions of people from information darkness

industrywide royalty reform and the creation of the charitable rhythm blues foundation died on dec 30 at a hospital in lebanon n.h he was 74 his wife julie eilber said the cause was injuries he sustained in a skiing accident on dec 24 mr begle rhymes with eagle was a successful corporate lawyer with a specialty in media mergers and a roster of high-profile arts clients like the kennedy center when in 1982 a friend encouraged him to meet ruth brown the singer of 1950s r&b classics like teardrops from my eyes and mama he treats your daughter mean a lifelong fan of ms brown’s music mr begle met her after a performance and brought along some records for her to sign when she told mr begle that she had not received any royalties in decades he said he would look into the problem ms brown had spent years trying to recover royalties from her former record company atlantic one of the label’s earliest and biggest stars she was so associated with atlantic that it was sometimes called the house that ruth built but she had not been paid since leaving the label in the early 1960s in the fallow years of her career she had worked as a maid and a bus driver like most artists of her generation ms brown had signed contracts with very low royalty rates hers was 5 percent compared with a standard of about 15 percent today many of those artists particularly black ones in genres like blues and r&b were further exploited through shoddy bookkeeping and questionable business practices excessive expenses were often charged against artists accounts leaving them eternally indebted to their labels and therefore ineligible for royalties digging through the accounts of ms brown and other atlantic artists including the coasters the drifters and big joe turner mr begle found further problems since 1969 for example the label had simply stopped mailing quarterly statements although they were contractually required to for a 1985 atlantic r&b compilation ms brown and mr turner’s accounts had been charged for new mastering editing and mixing expenses such practices were widespread but atlantic was a vulnerable target ahmet ertegun the most prominent of the label’s founders was revered in the industry and had a reputation for treating artists well ms brown’s case threatened to undermine that as a seasoned washington insider mr begle also knew how to pressure atlantic and its parent company warner communications ms brown testified before a congressional panel and was interviewed by a sympathetic meredith vieira on west 57th a cbs newsmagazine in 1986 steve ross the chief executive of warner communications met with mr begle and the rev jesse jackson throughout this campaign mr begle considered ms brown his most valuable weapon i truly believed in ruth because this woman was tough as nails he was quoted as saying in the last sultan the life and times of ahmet ertegun a 2011 biography by robert greenfield i knew i could trust her and i believe atlantic knew she was not going to be bought off mr begle did his work pro bono his firm verner liipfert bernhard mcpherson and hand wrote off at least 60,000 in expenses both ruth brown and ahmet ertegun died in 2006 in 1988 as pressure mounted on mr ertegun leading up to the celebration of atlantic’s 40th anniversary the label announced that it would waive the unrecouped debts and recalculate royalties for ms brown and others of its r&b artists back to 1970 files were incomplete before that date the company said ms brown received her first royalty payment in 28 years for about 20,000 a donation from atlantic of nearly 2 million that year helped create the rhythm blues foundation which gives grants to artists in need mr begle was its first executive director in time most other major labels followed atlantic’s lead in giving legacy artists improved royalty rates a memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018 the singer-songwriter bonnie raitt a founding board member of the foundation said in a statement howell’s dedication and tenacity in fighting for royalty reform and recognition for the whole generation of pioneer r&b artists who were denied both in the measure they deserve will always make him a hero to me howell edward begle jr was born in detroit on jan 4 1944 after his parents divorced he moved with his mother lucille to scottsdale ariz and later to stuart fla he graduated from the university of the south in sewanee tenn in 1965 with a degree in political science his wife said he had fed his love of r&b at wild parties on the campus where bands like doug clark and the hot nuts performed mr begle received a law degree from the university of michigan in 1968 and was soon drafted into the army he was commissioned a captain despite having no military education stationed in okinawa he worked in the judge advocate general’s corps the military law division while there he also booked concerts by acts like ike and tina turner he moved to washington and joined verner liipfert after leaving the army in 1973 becoming a partner in later years he operated his own firm howell begle and associates based at his home in boston he continued to represent the kennedy center for its annual honors event as well as the american film institute and the academy awards clearing the rights to film clips for the oscars broadcast besides his wife his survivors include three sons mark matthew and charles a daughter kristin edwards a sister cathy deggeller and three grandchildren in a 1990 interview with rolling stone ms brown said that in the midst of her battle with atlantic mr ertegun once visited her backstage while she was performing in the off broadway show staggerlee they embraced and he told her that everything’s going to be all right that he would never let anything happen to her then ms brown recalled before mr ertegun left he added you know ruth you got a good lawyer

2021-02-14T20:53:34.012Z - articleBody received: when faced with an actual or potential diagnosis of cancer most people are inclined to consult dr google often before they see a real live medical expert unfortunately dr google doesn’t always know what’s best a generation ago patients were largely dependent upon the physicians they consulted as to how best to deal with a disease like cancer nowadays there’s the internet replete with a virtual tsunami of information offered by all kinds of sources from experts equipped with evidence-based facts to people selling products or outright quackery the trick is to know how to tell the difference especially since the disparate guidance provided can become a matter of life or death it’s easy for people to land on a site filled with misinformation that leads them to make decisions that may not be in their best interests dr lidia schapira medical oncologist at stanford university medical center told me she is editor of the very reliable site www.cancer.net that provides clear scientifically vetted information about cancer and its treatment for patients their families and friends as a specialist in breast cancer dr schapira has treated women who decline postoperative therapy with a drug like tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor because they read on the web that the treatments are harmful despite extensive studies showing they can help prevent a breast cancer recurrence the conviction about harm is an emotional reaction and it’s very difficult for a doctor to talk facts through emotions she said as the american cancer society cautions the wrong information can hurt you when it comes to cancer a lot of what passes for cancer information on the internet is made up of opinion salesmanship and testimonials and is not grounded in careful science anyone can post any kind of information online and some people may be passing along information that’s limited inaccurate or just plain wrong some even try to deceive you worried about an unexplained symptom the internet offers about two dozen symptom checkers and patients can actually freak themselves out by searching the web for their symptoms and finding cancer as a possible cause just about any symptom from a persistent cough to chronic constipation can be caused by cancer but a qualified doctor can readily rule out cancer with a proper medical examination and review of a patient’s personal and family history last year in the hartford courant dr david w wolpaw a family physician in manchester conn described a man in his 20s with a weekslong sore throat who had done an internet search and thought he had oral cancer the doctor reported that the man lacked risk factors for cancer and an exam showed he had nothing worse than a cold people shouldn’t expect a website to replace their physician dr wolpaw wrote in addition to having completed many years of education and hands-on experience your doctor knows you your medical history family history risk factors etc much better than the internet he added furthermore he wrote sites can look trustworthy even when they post information not supported by scientific evidence people looking for the latest iteration of snake oil will surely find it on the web steer clear the cancer society cautions to beware of any postings that make claims like scientific breakthrough secret ingredient miraculous cure or ancient remedy as well as products offering money-back guarantees available from only one source or said to cure a wide range of ailments that said people facing cancer often can glean valuable information and support through the internet the internet can be a tool that can give people access to good scientifically vetted information dr schapira said it can help patients be better prepared for a consultation with an expert and after such a consultation they can check on the wisdom of the advice they got she suggests relying on web-based resources that are free of commercial interests even sites posted by medical institutions can be self-promoting in addition to www.cancer.net which is prepared by members of the american society of clinical oncology dr schapira recommended information offered by the american cancer society www.cancer.org and the national cancer institute www.cancer.gov as well as the free patient-oriented arm of a site called uptodate that translates into lay terms the best available information that doctors get the cancer institute notes that the three letters attached to a site’s domain name can give people insight into the independence and validity of information it contains best to choose edu or gov over com in addition to providing valuable information and guidance to trustworthy sources the internet can help patients glean psychosocial support through online groups in a review of 170 studies of patients who use information technology danielle gentile of the levine cancer institute of atrium health in charlotte n.c and her co-authors found that social media communities can be very helpful to cancer patients especially those who lack personal social support cancer patients can converse with others anonymously or otherwise about emotional and spiritual issues and glean helpful firsthand tips on dealing with treatment-related issues but while some online communities are curated by medical professionals others may be posted by people who have no scientific knowledge dr schapira cautioned the information patients glean through such lay communities is best discussed with their doctors lest they be led down the garden path of bad advice she also suggested that patients not be pressured to research their cancers until and unless they are emotionally and intellectually ready to deal with the information they uncover it may be better to let others look things up she said different people need different information at different times some people are not ready to absorb all the information upfront and that’s completely normal some want to receive the information but leave decisions to the experts while others want to have a hand in making the decisions don’t be afraid to discuss alternative remedies with the doctors treating your cancer and be sure to tell them about any such remedy you plan to try in case it can interact badly with prescribed treatments nearly all major medical centers now have departments of integrative medicine and today’s oncologists are well aware of how much the mind can influence the body’s well-being dr schapira said

2021-02-14T20:53:34.075Z - articleBody received: los angeles do you know what today is asked patty jenkins on a rainy tuesday in january chris pine shook his head it was a morbid anniversary seventy-two years before elizabeth short an aspiring actress known later as the black dahlia was brutally murdered and dismembered possibly in the bowels of the mansion where they sat the sowden house built by lloyd wright a son of frank’s it was home briefly to george hodel a prominent gynecologist who was widely suspected of the murder mr pine was familiar with the story fresh off their success with wonder woman in which mr pine starred under ms jenkins’s direction the two of them had filmed a tv project here in 2017 tied to the black dahlia murder of 1947 i got a little nauseous she said about visiting the house’s basement and dizzy a dizzying setting perhaps but appropriate for the project she was filming which debuts monday i am the night a six-episode limited series on tnt starring mr pine that is loosely based on the 2008 memoir one day she’ll darken by mr hodel’s granddaughter fauna hodel a noir-soaked mystery set in 1965 the series is a return to tv for ms jenkins and the realization of a passion project over a decade in the making ms jenkins first became interested in bringing ms hodel’s story to the screen in 2008 when a mutual friend introduced the two women she laid on me the most incredible true story ms jenkins said of that first encounter with ms hodel who went on to become a close friend and i was just so completely blown away by it that i couldn’t stop thinking about it and talking about it a white girl raised by her adoptive black mother to believe she was of mixed racial origins ms hodel had a difficult upbringing in nevada unaware of her true background in search of her biological mother she traveled to los angeles only then to discover her family’s shadowy past vanity fair later called her memoir the stuff of which movies are made ms jenkins agreed originally conceiving of the project as a film at one point oprah winfrey’s harpo productions was attached but the material proved ultimately too dense for a feature and the project sat in limbo the idea of the limited series wasn’t as chic she said before the success in 2014 of hbo’s true detective with the blockbuster success of wonder woman in 2017 which earned nearly 822 million ms jenkins’s career reached new heights wonder woman gave her leverage but that achievement also made it somewhat surprising that night landed at a basic-cable network better known for sitcoms and procedurals i don’t see anything as too minor or too major said ms jenkins who followed up her oscar-winning debut feature monster by directing episodes of arrested development on fox i like to do things i believe could be great not only did tnt get it but they were excited about it the network happily accommodated the short window she had at the end of 2017 to direct the first two episodes she then handed the directorial reins over to victoria mahoney seven seconds and carl franklin devil in a blue dress and left to begin preproduction on wonder woman 1984 scheduled for release in 2020 the episodes this team created for i am the night are heavily fictionalized though based on ms hodel’s gripping memoir in the pilot a teenage version of ms hodel india eisley is presented as a little red riding hood in search of her grandfather as all manner of wolves close in she befriends mr pine’s character jay singletary a once-promising journalist whose career has been destroyed by george hodel jefferson mays mr pine who played the love interest in wonder woman jumped at the chance to work again with ms jenkins who first told him about the project on the set of wonder woman in 2016 she always has myriad ideas that she’s bandying about that she’ll see if i respond to said mr pine who has spent nearly half of the past three years working on projects with ms jenkins but this particular one she got really excited about mr pine got excited too like ms jenkins he is an executive producer on the series and his character a drug addicted korean war veteran who’s been reduced to the tabloid hustle presented new challenges jay is freakishly fascinatingly delightfully strange he said i have a greater compassion for him than i have for many of the characters i’ve played because he’s so tragic shot on location around los angeles the series examines issues of identity corruption and truth as focused through a noir lens appropriate to its themes as fauna tracks her family she also unearths the suspicions about her grandfather’s possible role in the dahlia and other murders ms jenkins felt that the black dahlia mystery which remains unsolved possibly because of george hodel’s powerful connections was the show’s trojan horse the killer’s identity was reportedly one of hollywood’s best-kept secrets and it became just one of fauna’s both real and fictional many painful discoveries nobody can prove exactly what happened to the black dahlia but the people involved with this story uncovered incredible complexities about themselves said ms jenkins i am the night is the first proper collaboration between ms jenkins and her husband the author sam sheridan a fighter’s heart it was mr sheridan a noir fan and the series’s showrunner who thought to cast mr pine who had played the comely captain kirk in star trek as the troubled journalist the suggestion appealed to ms jenkins who saw jay’s desperation and gallows humor as a refreshing change for her friend this character had shades of chris that i hadn’t gotten to see him express said ms jenkins it’s getting into that vibe of somebody who really doesn’t like themselves and their place in the world when he was super young he always had to play the handsome leading man seated together in a small windowless room of the sowden house mr pine and ms jenkins exuded unmistakable chemistry you end up with a shorthand ms jenkins observed that’s why we were able to work so fast he teasingly wondered if the built-in aquarium reminded her of her deceased pet fishtopher patty has a relationship to fish that one would have with a dog or a cat he joked she waggled her fingers around her face to illustrate how the japanese fighting fish used to greet her they erupted with laughter their tight working relationship was quickly forged on the set of wonder woman ms jenkins explained that it had been extremely challenging to cast the part of wonder woman’s love interest steve trevor whom she felt was often neutered in previous primarily male interpretations imagine if lois lane was dull as dishwater she said we’re making a movie for women as well this time i was looking for someone hilarious and cool but who also had a funny dynamic with emasculation in a way that made it a two-hander mr pine had turned down the wonder woman role in 2015 when another director was attached but within five minutes of meeting with ms jenkins who acted out an abridged version of the film as part of her pitch he was sold he is reprising the role in the sequel long story short i like patty he said she sees me the way i want to be seen ms jenkins has become a dependable teller of gruesome tales about women and violence in addition to monster based on the life of the serial killer aileen wuornos she also directed the somber pilot for amc’s whodunit drama the killing what captivated her most about ms hodel’s story though was not its sordid nature but ms hodel’s resilience and joy i’m a filmmaker because i’m interested in people and what is possible in this world she said ms hodel who had breast cancer did not get to see the project completed she died in september 2017 having read only the pilot script her daughters however rasha pecoraro and yvette gentile were granted generous access to the set during production it brought mom back to life for us said ms gentile their podcast root of evil debuts feb 13 and will further explore events from the family’s perspective the podcast will feature tape-recorded interviews with family members conducted by ms hodel who continued to search for answers all her life ms jenkins said she wanted to believe her friend would have liked the series it’s always the thing i am most nervous about with anybody’s true story she said we tried to honor the truth of her character as much as we could hopefully her wonderful spirit permeated everything

2021-02-14T20:53:34.540Z - articleBody received: twenty years into her career anne hathaway is used to being cast a certain way i’m not usually sent roles that are defined by the male gaze she said normally i get sent women who live and think for themselves to the extent that we do in this very sick world but at first glance in serenity steven knight’s noirish thriller opening jan 25 hathaway’s character appears to have spent her lifetime catering to the pleasures of men as karen hathaway makes a jaw-dropping entrance long blond tresses and soul-crushed eyes a femme fatale in white in the only bar on plymouth island and she has a proposition for her ex matthew mcconaughey a struggling boat captain take her violent new husband jason clarke out fishing then drop him in the ocean for the sharks in exchange for 10 million it’s the first entry in a big year for hathaway who stole the show from sandra bullock and cate blanchett in last spring’s ocean’s 8 come may she’ll appear in the hustle a female-centric remake of dirty rotten scoundrels with rebel wilson followed by the last thing he wanted dee rees’s adaptation of the joan didion novel about a reporter turned arms dealer and modern love an amazon series spun from the new york times column when she’s not on set hathaway 36 lives in new york with her husband the producer actor and jewelry designer adam shulman and their son jonathan 2 he’s like butter she said sighing deeply those moments they cuddle up into you just because they want to calling from a family vacation spot somewhere north of los angeles hathaway spoke about the actresses who still floor her and hollywood’s echo chamber of men here are edited excerpts from the conversation karen is a dramatic pivot from the roles we’re used to seeing you in were you immediately game i was very surprised when i got the script for serenity and found out that steven wanted me i was just very honored and couldn’t wait to roll up my sleeves and dye my hair we know that secrets lurk on plymouth island and there will be no spoilers here but what was your reaction to the script when you first read it it knocks you i was on the edge of my seat i couldn’t wait to turn the page and see what was coming next as it became more surreal and thrilling i really love being a part of provocative movies that require a certain muscularity from the audience a certain level of mature film viewership one of my favorite things about serenity was how provoked i felt by it both in my mind and in the pit of my stomach later this spring you’re playing a high-class con artist in the comedy the hustle did you need a lift after the darkness of serenity you know i never thought i’d be able to say what i’m about to say i did it for the fun of it it just seemed like it was going to be a blast and it mostly was mostly i was a little bit too assured in my confidence that i’d be able to convince the powers that be that my character shouldn’t be british she should be american i thought i was going to win that one up until the day before filming so then i was tasked with doing the thing that is the hardest in the world for me which is pulling off a british accent all of a sudden it went from feeling like you had a rocket strapped to your back to feeling like you’re on a tightrope and there was no net you seem to enjoy a comic thrill ride like daphne kluger the narcissistic actress in ocean’s 8 from what demented place did you conjure her up well it was fun to apply a lot of observation that i’ve made over the past 20 years or so about the incredibly ridiculous world of celebrity to send that up with my tongue firmly in my cheek she was just such a trip i loved playing someone who was so transparent and yet so blind to herself you went into ocean’s 8 saying do not embarrass yourself in front of your heroes what on earth were you worried about oh i think i was worried that everyone would like each other and secretly not like me and i’d just be kind of outside of it in the past i’ve let my excitement get the best of me and i just wanted to sit back and enjoy the experience and not try to fill it with my own enthusiasm but to take in how truly glorious it was to be in the presence of so many queens you’ve often told the story of how nervous you were around meryl streep in the devil wears prada and here i am suddenly feeling rather tongue-tied around you oh gosh no aim higher laughs but seriously is there anyone now who could possibly intimidate you yes i burst into tears when i met julia roberts and it wasn’t like 20 years ago it was recent history it’s a strange thing to find yourself right smack dab in the middle of a place where you are not born where you have no reason to imagine yourself and yet somehow there you are it sometimes produces how do i say this weirdness and awkwardness and i’m learning to just say thank you and not make such a fuss about it and have a good time you’re one of the more than 300 women in film television and theater involved in the time’s up initiative what’s your take on the movement’s accomplishments this past year all i can represent is my own experience which is i was ignorant of all the effort that has gone into keeping women separated and now that i’ve found my sisters and my arms are linked with them i’m never letting go on instagram you cited a recent study that found that female-led films earn more than ones starring men and yet pay inequity is still a huge issue the reason i think that there’s resistance is that hollywood has been full of men who would describe themselves as good but who have been in echo chambers full of other men who look and think like them this doesn’t make these men bad but it does mean that the conversations being had at the highest levels of power are by default limited looking back at your 2012 oscar-winning turn as fantine in les misérables i was reminded that you have an impressive set of pipes are you singing much these days my son hates my voice peals of laughter he doesn’t like it when i sing so no i’m really not there’s a couple peppa pig songs he lets me sing and man i lean into those so hard

2021-02-14T20:53:35.085Z - articleBody received: a specter is haunting the supreme court disrespect for the second amendment perhaps you haven’t realized that the supreme court’s disinclination to expand on its landmark 2008 decision creating an individual right to gun ownership means that the justices are treating the second amendment as a second-class right a watered-down right a disfavored right if you are unaware of these outlandish claims then you haven’t tuned into the rising chorus of judicial voices demanding more from the supreme court than gun fanciers already won in that intensely disputed 5-to-4 decision a decade ago district of columbia v heller why is this happening and why now to understand why the second-class right meme is suddenly penetrating the judicial conversation we have to begin with justice clarence thomas he is not the first member of the current supreme court to use the phrase justice samuel alito jr used it in his 2010 opinion that extended the analysis of the heller decision which had applied only to washington d.c as a federal enclave to the states the court was being asked justice alito wrote in mcdonald v city of chicago to treat the right recognized in heller as a second-class right which he said the court would not do but it is justice thomas who has taken up the phrase as a weapon using it in a series of opinions over the past four years to accuse his colleagues of failing in their duty to keep pushing back against limitations on gun ownership and use the opinions were all dissents from the court’s decisions not to hear particular gun-rights appeals in 2015 for example he wrote that the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit had been wrong to uphold an illinois city’s ban on assault weapons and that by refusing to hear the appeal his colleagues had failed to prevent the seventh circuit from relegating the second amendment to a second-class right last year objecting to the court’s decision not to hear a challenge to california’s 10-day waiting period for gun purchases justice thomas mused that i suspect that four members of this court would vote to review a 10-day waiting period for abortions he declared the right to keep and bear arms is apparently this court’s constitutional orphan in another opinion this time joined by justice neil gorsuch justice thomas said it was indefensible and untenable for the court of appeals for the ninth circuit to have upheld california’s ban on carrying concealed weapons by turning down the appeal he wrote the justices were enabling the treatment of the second amendment as a disfavored right and in a remarkable concluding paragraph to his eight-page opinion he added for those of us who work in marbled halls guarded constantly by a vigilant and dedicated police force the guarantees of the second amendment might seem antiquated and superfluous but the framers made a clear choice they reserved to all americans the right to bear arms for self-defense i do not think we should stand by idly while a state denies its citizens that right particularly when their very lives may depend on it by calling attention to justice thomas’s second amendment crusade i want to make four points first he’s simply wrong the court decided heller to vindicate what the majority described as a core second amendment right the right of an individual to keep a handgun at home for self-defense that’s all whatever else the second amendment enables people to do with their guns was left open as justice antonin scalia observed in his majority opinion it is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose maybe justice scalia included that and a few other disclaimers in order to stay within the comfort zone of a member of his narrowest of majorities probably justice anthony m kennedy or maybe he was just kicking the can down the road in any event it’s certainly not the case that justices who decline to overturn a 10-day waiting period can be accurately labeled hypocrites who are content to hide in their marble palace while leaving the populace unprotected nor is the second amendment absolutism that justice thomas is calling for reflected in the way the supreme court interprets most other constitutional guarantees judge bruce selya of the court of appeals for the first circuit made this point in a majority opinion in november rejecting a challenge to a provision of the massachusetts gun licensing statute even though the second amendment right is fundamental judge selya an appointee of president ronald reagan wrote in his opinion for a unanimous panel the plaintiffs have offered us no valid reason to treat it more deferentially than other important constitutional rights that decision gould v morgan will shortly be appealed to the supreme court my second point is to underscore the role justice thomas plays in creating this rhetorical tidal wave he is a federalist society icon and a hero to many young conservative lawyers including the 10 former thomas law clerks whom president trump has already appointed to federal judgeships a dozen other former thomas clerks hold important nonjudicial positions in the administration they and their colleagues among the new trump judges many of whom clerked for other conservative justices are the ones who are making the second-class right mantra a standard feature of any second amendment dissent in other words not only that a particular majority opinion is incorrect but that it is part of a dangerous trend that the supreme court by implication if not explicitly needs to address right now for example the full 15-member court of appeals for the fifth circuit recently refused to reconsider a decision by a three-judge panel to uphold the longstanding federal ban on interstate sales of handguns dissenting from that refusal judge james c ho a former thomas clerk who joined the fifth circuit last year cited justice thomas’s opinions in observing yet the second amendment continues to be treated as a second-class right his dissent included a subtle dig at chief justice john roberts who notably has not joined justice thomas’s second amendment choir the government rationale for the ban on interstate handgun sales is that while federally licensed firearm dealers can be expected to know the laws of their own state they may not be familiar with laws of other states and so may not know whether an out-of-state purchaser is legally entitled to own a gun that is not sufficient justification for the ban judge ho wrote if dealers could learn their own state’s laws they could learn other states laws as well put simply the way to require compliance with state handgun laws is to require compliance with state handgun laws he wrote in a riff on the chief justice’s much-discussed line in a 2007 school integration case the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race judge ho’s fifth circuit colleague don r willett another new member of the court observed in his own dissenting opinion in the same case the second amendment is neither second class nor second rate nor second tier an appeal in that case mance v whitaker is now pending at the supreme court and the justices will decide this month or next whether to accept it another new judge stephanos bibas dissented last month from a decision by a panel of the court of appeals for the third circuit that upheld a new jersey law limiting a firearm magazine to 10 rounds of ammunition he said the state had failed to provide sufficient evidence that specifically links large magazines to mass-shooting deaths acknowledging that five other federal circuit courts have also upheld limits on magazine sizes judge bibas observed that while judges were understandably concerned about gun violence they err in subjecting the second amendment to different watered-down rules and demanding little if any proof the second amendment is an equal part of the bill of rights judge bibas wrote we may not water it down and balance it away based on our own sense of wise policy that case is likely to be appealed to the supreme court the new jersey affiliate of the national rifle association which brought the case is first seeking review by the full third circuit the 49-year-old judge bibas a former law professor won plaudits for his dissenting opinion it is easy to see why president trump chose to appoint him said an article on the website ammoland.com that appeared under the headline third circuit second amendment is a second rate right john o mcginnis a well-known conservative professor at northwestern university law school writing on the law and liberty website called judge bibas’s dissent the judicial equivalent of a perfect game a first-round knockout or a checkmate within 10 moves he added it will not be the last opinion of the trump appellate judges that will shake the judiciary from its dogmatic slumber my third point is this professor mcginniss may well be right at least when it comes to the second amendment the substitution of brett kavanaugh for justice kennedy may do the trick on his former court the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit justice kavanaugh took an aggressive gun-rights position dissenting in 2011 from a decision that upheld the district’s ban on certain assault rifles calling the majority’s analytical approach to the case especially inappropriate then-judge kavanaugh wrote a ban on a class of arms is not an incidental regulation it is equivalent to a ban on a category of speech as a matter of constitutional doctrine i understand his argument that a right deemed by the supreme court to be fundamental whether under the first amendment or the second is entitled to the highest level of judicial protection nonetheless to analogize possession of assault rifles to the right to free speech is a provocative move the two conservative judges who made up the majority on the three-judge panel douglas ginsburg and karen lecraft henderson were sufficiently provoked by judge kavanaugh’s 52-page dissent that they added to their own opinion an unusual six-page appendix for the specific purpose of contesting his arguments the dissent mischaracterizes the question before us judge ginsburg wrote for himself and judge henderson we simply do not read heller as foreclosing every ban on every possible sub-class of handguns or for that matter a ban on a sub-class of rifles justice thomas himself has cited judge kavanaugh’s dissenting opinion favorably it would hardly be surprising for justice kavanaugh to return the favor and join the crusade and that brings me to my final point the supreme court’s appetite for expanding the second amendment if such an appetite develops will be wildly out of sync with the mood of the country as the times reported last month based on data compiled by a gun-control advocacy group public support for gun-control measures is surging state legislatures passed 69 gun-control measures in 2018 more than three times the number in the previous year more than half the states enacted at least one while 90 percent of bills the national rifle association backed at the state level were defeated even the trump administration has caught the trend with its announcement last month of a ban on bump stocks the cheap attachments that turn ordinary rifles into something close to machine guns and that the las vegas killer used to commit mass murder a year ago the ban to take effect in march has already drawn at least two lawsuits perhaps these lawsuits will be a step too far even for the second amendment newbies on the federal bench or maybe not does it matter if the public and the supreme court are running in opposite directions it’s good news to anyone who would like to accelerate the collapse of public confidence in the one organ of government that at the moment seems to stand between us and disaster for the rest of us it’s one more thing to worry about as the new year begins follow the new york times opinion section on facebook twitter nytopinion and instagram

2021-02-14T20:57:10.864Z - articleBody received: i always admired my uncle anas my mom’s youngest brother and a general in the egyptian police he helped shape my sense of justice and discipline when i was growing up i had nothing but respect and admiration for him and his work fighting bad guys throughout his career and unlike many of his colleagues he never believed he was above the law in a country where corruption is practically a way of life he refused to wave his badge to get out of paying the train fare or to avoid everyday inconveniences he genuinely believed that the police were there to maintain order and serve the people then a coup came between us after egypt’s generals overthrew president mohamed morsi in july 2013 i started attending and live-tweeting the huge sit-in in cairo protesting the restoration of military rule just 30 months after egyptians had risen up against it on aug 14 of that year police and soldiers including my uncle’s unit surrounded and attacked the sprawling protest camp at least 800 people were killed some estimates put the number at more than 1,000 and some 4,000 more were injured i was one of them as the police cleared the sit-in that morning i was shot in the arm a few days later the police broke into my parents home looking for my father who served in mr morsi’s government instead i was arrested a few weeks later my father was arrested too i counted on uncle anas to come to my rescue while rotting in solitary confinement i had many daydreams about him knocking down the prison walls to save me my father and our fellow prisoners from torture and abuse but he never came why did he abandon us in the months before the coup egypt became pitted against itself those who supported ousting mr morsi including their backers in the state media had dehumanized a large subset of egyptian society the muslim brotherhood and anyone believed to be sympathetic to them i felt the tension rising at every family or social gathering where small disagreements took on a new viciousness anti-revolution rhetoric cloaked itself in anti-islamism and conspiracy theories were everywhere the muslim brotherhood was painted as the diabolical enemy of their fellow countrymen i am not a member of the muslim brotherhood my father a respected authority on islamic jurisprudence lived most of his life outside of egypt but was affiliated with a progressive moderate vision of islamism most important we both opposed the coup i can only guess that my uncle thought the stability of egypt required him to stand by the crackdown or that he was afraid of associating with his now-dissident relatives he never came not even to visit even though a visit from him could have eased the conditions of my imprisonment with every insult every incident of torture my resentment grew how could my own uncle sleep in the comfort of his home knowing his nephew and brother-in-law were facing so much injustice he was supposed to be better than the rest to maintain sanity i suppressed my memories of the massacre and displaced the pain of my imprisonment into anger toward my uncle i lashed out at my mother during her brief prison visits when she would make excuses for him and apologetically suggest that he might come by once things cooled down a bit i blamed him and every other officer who worked for the regime hate was the simplest solution a 489-day hunger strike an international campaign and pressure from washington helped me regain my freedom on may 30 2015 i felt more solidarity from strangers than i did from some of my own blood relatives a few months after my release my uncle was severely injured in a suspected terrorist attack in sinai where he was stationed my mother implored me to offer sympathy i refused to call i almost felt a sense of justice two years later uncle anas was still unable to walk it had been nearly a year since he had surgery for a spinal fracture he sustained as a result of the attack and his muscles had not recovered medical exams revealed a fatal diagnosis amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or a.l.s a degenerative illness i still could not bring myself to call my uncle but as i watched my mother grieve i began to rethink i came to realize that in my self-righteous pursuit of justice i had committed injustice against myself and my loved ones my resentment blinded me to what was truly important my empathy and humanity i had dehumanized one of my most beloved just as he had dehumanized me i was angry at him for abandoning me while i was in prison yet when he became a prisoner of his own body i was ready to abandon him last summer i made peace with my uncle it was the most difficult experience i have had since i left prison i called him on the first day of eid and i could hear the slightly panicked excitement in his voice as we exchanged greetings he spoke faster than usual as if trying to make up for lost time the weight of the resentment i carried vanished as soon as the conversation turned to kids marriage health and the famous feast that my aunt makes every eid as i ended our five years of silence i felt the same sensation of freedom i had experienced when i was released soon after my mom told me that the call had done wonders for his morale and that he had accompanied her on a visit to my father who remains in prison my father served in the morsi government i was imprisoned for my activism my uncle was a police officer under successive regimes many other family members were army generals or politicians under the government of the former president hosni mubarak is my family unique in many ways not at all most egyptian families are similarly split across the country’s political divides with rampant state violence and the absence of any semblance of justice egyptian society is beyond polarized it is broken the targeting and dehumanization has extended beyond islamists now anyone who dares to challenge the status quo is demonized families remain strained political differences seem existential dinner tables still have empty seats many weddings birthdays and funerals are missed because of imprisonment exile or exclusion the hate anger and vengeance have somehow overrun human decency i don’t know how egypt will heal but i do know that it will begin with each of us finding the strength to let love and hope transcend hate and grievance even though i may never get to see my favorite uncle again i am prohibited from re-entering egypt and he won’t be able to make it to the united states a single phone call proved a powerful antidote to the venom we had been fed my uncle and i took back the humanity that was stripped away from us with a simple act of love mohamed soltan soltanlife is the founder of the freedom initiative an advocacy group for prisoners of conscience

2021-02-14T20:57:11.190Z - articleBody received: mexico city the allegation landed like a bombshell in the united states one of the world’s biggest drug kingpins had paid a 100 million bribe to the former president of mexico enrique peña nieto yet in mexico the claim made on tuesday in a brooklyn courtroom by a former ally of the drug lord joaquín guzmán loera known as el chapo was met with barely a shrug the news did not lead any of mexico’s major daily newspapers on wednesday nobody raised the issue at the morning news conference of the current president andrés manuel lópez obrador usually a daily billboard of the nation’s most pressing political issues mexicans were far more concerned with quotidian matters such as whether they would be able to refuel their cars a gas crisis has crippled supplies around the country and whether the new government would get the votes it needs to create a new national security apparatus part of its plan to curb violence ensuring justice is done is not in our hands said dolores haro 59 who was eating lunch at a taco counter in mexico city on wednesday she said most people she knew had more pressing worries like the gas shortage and allegations of corruption even on such a monumental scale are not that surprising added pedro rodríguez 28 a marketing executive eating at the same counter we mexicans are no longer shocked he said we know that there won’t be a response the muted reaction reflected in part hardened skepticism about the honesty of the nation’s political class and the strength of its government institutions in a culture of rampant corruption and impunity analysts said many mexicans doubt that a charge of public corruption even one of this magnitude would get traction in the mexican justice system especially in cases that probe the opaque intersection of organized crime and government we understand that there is weak rule of law the lack of capacity for investigation said guadalupe correa-cabrera a professor of policy and government at george mason university who studies organized crime in mexico the names of politicians turn up in trial but nothing happens she said that a long history of impunity had left mexicans feeling hopeless and asking why should i care mr peña nieto whose six-year term ended late last year has made no public statement in response to the allegations but close associates from his administration issued denials on his behalf including his former chief of staff francisco guzmán who is not related to the accused drug trafficker and who called the allegations false defamatory and absurd the government of epn was the one that located arrested and extradited joaquín guzmán loera mr guzmán said on twitter since the beginning of the administration it was a priority objective of the security cabinet while some mexicans allowed for the possibility that there might be some truth in the allegations made by alex cifuentes villa a colombian drug trafficker who worked closely with the mexican drug lord from 2007 to 2013 doubt seemed to prevail among those who followed the issue we have a very bad experience with protected witnesses said max kaiser a mexican lawyer who helped write mexico’s anticorruption laws we know that protected witnesses can say anything he said that the lack of reaction in mexico less reflected resignation than a lack of confidence in the source of the allegation what people are waiting for is that these allegations are backed up with evidence he said adding that if the allegations were proven it would be a major scandal if nothing more is presented he continued it would just be hearsay from a narcotrafficker hoping for some kind of benefit maría celia toro a political analyst at the colegio de méxico a university in mexico city said that mexicans have been conditioned by a long history of false accusations she added the most sensible thing to do is to wait many observers pointed out that if mr guzmán had indeed paid mr peña nieto 100 million then he did not get much bang for his buck since he was eventually extradited to the united states by the president mr cifuentes dated the alleged bribe to october 2012 and mr guzmán was captured for the first time in february 2014 he later escaped from prison only to be recaptured in january 2016 and extradited in january 2017 it isn’t logical that you would pay a bribe so that in a few years you will be captured said juan alberto cedillo a mexican journalist who has investigated mexican organized crime groups for more than a decade in addition mr peña nieto might have surmised that any deals the two men had brokered would likely have arisen during judicial proceedings in the united states for all his faults and flaws peña nieto captured chapo and extradited him knowing full well that any information would filter out said alejandro hope a security expert with a mexican consulting firm the group of economists and associates the guy was being hunted down from day 1 of peña nieto’s administration some who have questioned the veracity of mr cifuentes’s testimony also pointed out that mr peña nieto is still in mexico he attended the funeral of a former governor of his home state several days ago his first public appearance since leaving office were he guilty some contended he might have taken a page from the playbook of other politicians and fled or gone into hiding during mr peña nieto’s term in office his administration and his party the institutional revolutionary party were tarred by corruption scandals including several that implicated powerful former governors the president saw his initial popularity begin to wane when his wife purchased a home from a government contractor on favorable terms the allegations leveled against mr peña nieto this week were on a completely different scale but even the former president’s political opponents are treading lightly senator marco gama of the conservative national action party said that the party was waiting to see if the trial in brooklyn would produce any evidence to back up the accusations to start an investigation you need proof he said and none has been presented hours after mr cifuentes gave his account federal prosecutors filed a sealed motion seeking to limit similar testimony when the motion was unsealed on wednesday evening it showed that prosecutors had accused mr guzmán’s lawyers of trying to create a public sideshow in an attempt to damage united states foreign relations on wednesday morning the judge in the case pointed out that mr cifuentes had not testified about something he had done or seen himself but had merely told the jury something that mr guzmán had told him maybe he suggested to mr guzmán’s lawyers the prosecutors did not believe mr guzman had been entirely candid still some mexicans felt the need to do something to protest to investigate and if it were the case to prosecute mr peña nieto they should try him here or there wherever said armando venado 58 a salesman from the town of texcoco outside mexico city we’re so accustomed to corruption that nobody does anything nobody protests

2021-02-14T20:57:11.428Z - articleBody received: washington so it has come to this the president of the united states was asked over the weekend whether he is a russian agent and he refused to directly answer the question which came from a friendly interviewer not one of the fake media journalists he disparages was the most insulting thing i’ve ever been asked he declared but it is a question that has hung over his presidency now for two years if the now 23-day government shutdown standoff between mr trump and congress has seemed ugly it may eventually seem tame in light of what is to come the border wall fight is just the preliminary skirmish in this new era of divided government the real battle has yet to begin with democrats now in charge of the house the special counsel believed to be wrapping up his investigation news media outlets competing for scoops and the first articles of impeachment already filed mr trump faces the prospect of an all-out political war for survival that may make the still-unresolved partial government shutdown pale by comparison the last few days have offered plenty of foreshadowing the newly empowered democrats summoned the president’s longtime personal lawyer to testify after he implicated mr trump in an illegal scheme to arrange hush payments before the 2016 election for women who claimed to have had affairs with him legal papers disclosed that mr trump’s onetime campaign chairman shared polling data with an associate tied by prosecutors to russian intelligence new reports over the weekend added to the sense of siege at the white house the new york times reported that after mr trump fired the f.b.i director james b comey in 2017 the bureau opened an investigation into whether the president was working for the russians and the washington post reported that mr trump has gone out of his way as president to hide the details of his discussions with president vladimir v putin of russia even from members of his own administration what all this adds up to remains unclear whether it will lead to a full-blown impeachment inquiry in the house has yet to be decided but it underscores the chance that with candidates already lining up to take him on in 2020 washington will spend the months to come debating the future of mr trump’s presidency and the direction of the country the reality said andy surabian a republican strategist and former special assistant to mr trump is that the next two years are going to be nonstop political war the white house has begun recruiting soldiers the new white house counsel pat cipollone has hired 17 new lawyers according to the post as he prepares for a barrage of subpoenas from house democratic committee chairmen but mr trump’s inner circle has shrunk and he has fewer advisers around him whom he trusts his white house chief of staff is still serving in an acting capacity and the west wing is depleted by the shutdown as he himself wrote on twitter this weekend there’s almost nobody in the w.h but me mr surabian said the rest of the party must recognize the threat and rally behind the president republicans need to understand that democrats in congress beholden to the resistance aren’t interested in bipartisanship they’re out for blood he said it’s a war we can win he added but only with fortitude unity coherent messaging and a willingness to fight back democrats for their part say they are out for accountability not blood intent on forcing a president who went largely unchecked by a republican congress during his first two years in office to come clean on the many scandals that have erupted involving his business taxes campaign and administration they plan to get started in the coming days on tuesday they will grill former attorney general william p barr who has been nominated by mr trump to assume his old office again about his approach to the special counsel robert s mueller iii mr barr wrote a private memo last year criticizing mr mueller’s investigation and democrats will use his confirmation hearings to press him on whether the special counsel will be allowed to finish his work and report it to congress senator chuck schumer of new york the democratic minority leader also plans to force a vote in the senate this week on the trump administration’s plans to lifts sanctions on the companies of oleg v deripaska a russian oligarch close to mr putin’s government if he reduces his ownership stakes democrats plan to use the issue to argue that mr trump has been soft on russia even committees that are not usually in the investigation business are jumping into the fray representative eliot l engel democrat of new york and the new chairman of the house foreign affairs committee told the new yorker last week that he was eliminating the subcommittee on terrorism in favor of a subcommittee aimed at investigating mr trump’s foreign policy lost in all this may be any chance of bipartisan policymaking at stake in the current fight is just 5.7 billion for mr trump’s promised border wall roughly one-eighth of one percent of the total federal budget if one-eighth of one percent of the total budget can prompt the longest government shutdown in american history then the potential for further clashes over the remaining 99.87 percent seems considerable on issues like health care taxes climate change guns and national security the two sides start this era of divided government far apart that’s the flashing yellow light here said mayor rahm emanuel of chicago a former top white house aide to presidents bill clinton and barack obama if you can’t do government 101 what makes you think you’re going to do advanced placement government like finding the money for an infrastructure bill julian epstein who was the counsel for democrats on the house judiciary committee during mr clinton’s impeachment fight 20 years ago said big issues like a shrinking middle class largely untrained for the 21st-century economy would go unaddressed during the battles to come the political class is now addicted to manichaean conflict as a way of life mr epstein said it’s become the mother’s milk for base voters in both parties who together make up a minority share of voters for cable television and for social media given the investigations mr trump may prefer a battle over the wall as more favorable ground to fight even with 800,000 federal workers furloughed or forced to work without pay polls suggest he is not winning with the broader public but has rallied his base in the fight more americans blame mr trump for the government shutdown than blame democrats and most oppose a border wall according to a new survey by the post and abc news but support for a wall has grown over the last year from 34 percent to 42 percent fueled largely by republicans while opposition has slipped from 63 percent to 54 percent negotiations have broken down while mr trump had gambled that speaker nancy pelosi democrat of california would back down she has made clear that she has no interest in compromise she and mr schumer have insisted that mr trump reopen the government while negotiations over a border wall proceed which the president has refused to do mr trump walked out of their talks last week after he asked ms pelosi if she would support his wall if he reopened the government and she said no it’s all about their own sense of strength said john feehery a former senior house republican aide pelosi wants to be validated she wants to be seen as a strong leader trump feels like he has to govern through strength this is strength versus strength unfortunately the people in the middle are the government workers who can’t afford to lose a paycheck instead of talks to end the shutdown the president spent at least part of his weekend defending himself against the suspicions about his affinity for mr putin he insisted that he has actually been tougher on russia than his predecessors and that the f.b.i was led by losers that tried to do a number on your president he picked up the telephone on saturday night to call into the fox news show hosted by jeanine pirro who participated in a campaign rally with him last fall she asked him about the f.b.i investigation reported by the times with a tone of scorn i’m going to ask you are you now or have you ever worked for russia mr president ms pirro asked i think it’s the most insulting thing i’ve ever been asked he answered i think it’s the most insulting article i’ve ever had written and if you read the article you’d see that they found absolutely nothing she then cited the post article about his efforts to conceal details of his private meetings with mr putin we had a great conversation he said we were talking about israel and securing israel and lots of other things and it was a great conversation i’m not keeping anything under wraps i couldn’t care less ms pirro expressed sympathy for the battles he was waging you’ve got such fight in you it’s unbelievable she said well he answered i guess i have good genes

2021-02-14T20:57:11.479Z - articleBody received: woodmere n.y if there is a world in which theater kids rule andrew barth feldman seems to live there he wanders through the halls of his high school a lank 5-foot-6 disney-obsessed 16-year-old prone to bursting into song like the mayor photos of him dot the hallways teachers stop mid-lesson when they spot him in the hallway hoping he’ll come in and say hello to their classes a basketball star in the cafeteria smiles and waves the little kids in the library gawk as they hurtle by he’s long been a standout in their world the kid who was organizing flash mobs at fourth-grade assembly who founded his own theater company at 12 it’s still going who has been acting in school plays and camp shows and community theater productions for as long as anyone can remember and now he’s going to broadway even in an industry that delights in discovery this teenager’s right-place-right-time story is one for the books last june he was competing in the national high school musical theater awards known as the jimmys which he won when the lead producer of dear evan hansen happened to be in the audience she knew immediately she wanted him for the show and on jan 30 he assumes the title role playing broadway’s favorite socially anxious and ethically confused adolescent i’m so nervous all the time about it he said cleareyed candid and strikingly courteous as we talked in an empty classroom if i were to make my broadway debut in any role it’s evan he added somehow managing to be confident and self-doubting at the same time this is my favorite show since i saw it and everyone has always said i’m right for the role i think i agree the role is wrenching vocally and emotionally and andrew will be the first teenager to tackle it on broadway the character is 17 but adolescent boys are often thought to be too immature to play adolescent boys and all of his predecessors have been in their 20s ben platt who won a tony award originating the role was 23 when the show opened there’s the possibility of getting us something that’s authentic and original and vital and has never been seen said the show’s director michael greif andrew is so young and so new to the rigors of broadway that he’s going to begin his run doing just five performances a week while taking vocal lessons to shore up his stamina this will be his first professional production and the creative team determined to protect him as well as their smash-hit show has decided the reduced schedule is their way of investing in his long-term success the show’s alternate michael lee brown will do the other three performances as andrew builds comfort and strength it’s a little scary for all of us for him for me for his mom because we’re asking a lot of him said stacey mindich the show’s lead producer but in every single moment he has grown with us already at every passage he has shown us he is uber-capable this is not one of those stories about someone who happened into theater unwittingly this is a story about an unabashed theater geek a child who has adored broadway since he saw beauty and the beast at age 3 who has been happily singing on stage since he landed the role of mr bundles in a community theater production of annie at age 8 who writes songs and plays the piano guitar drums ukulele and bass who has been to all four editions of broadwaycon including the one last year where he won a lip-syncing competition while performing as angelica schuyler from hamilton his passion for the imaginary goes way beyond musicals he’s a huge fan of star wars we watched a new hope in english class to learn about archetypes and i was like oh my god this is the coolest thing and has dressed as general grievous and kylo ren for halloween it’s not that he’s drawn to the dark side it’s just he says that those characters look cooler he’s an even huger fan of disney which now owns star wars so maybe that’s redundant he estimates that he’s been to disney theme parks including disneyworld disneyland and disneyland paris at least 20 times starting when he was 6 months old something draws me to the idea of being able to live in another world he said and now he really really loves dear evan hansen the first time he saw the musical a couple of weeks after it opened on broadway in 2016 he was so overcome he couldn’t find the words to talk about it when his mother came to pick him up it really really hit hard he said i had never had such a visceral reaction to anything ever he started playing the cast album on repeat he sent songs to friends he saw it again and again he relates to evan and not just because he like the character lives with his single mom i mean i’m a teenager he said i’ve been lucky to never personally struggle with a diagnosis of anxiety or anything but i am a teenager of course i feel anxiety of course i feel nervous of course i feel alone he called evan a manifestation of what’s going on in our heads as teenagers he just can’t control what’s going on the outside as much as most of us can and he asserted with the confidence of a teenager who has been seeing as many broadway shows as he could for as long as he can remember there has never been a character so thoroughly real and authentic to that experience i asked andrew to show me around his high school lawrence woodmere academy a small private school in the five towns section of long island since he’ll be portraying a high school senior on broadway while still a high school junior himself of course as of a few weeks ago he’s not actually showing up for class broadway is too time-consuming so instead he’s being tutored for 15 hours a week he grew up nearby first in hewlett neck and then in woodmere his mother is an alumna and administrator at the school his father a lawyer lives in manhattan and he has an older sister his tight-knit family also includes his mother’s sister who lives down the street the sisters raised their children together and andrew regards his cousins as his brothers andrew has been performing nonstop since annie he had tried a variety of sports but didn’t like them he was better at teaching his fellow 9 and 10-year-olds to sing beatles tunes and then his parents marriage was splitting up and his ailing grandparents had moved into his house so his mother barbra feldman was thrilled that he had found something he could do in a place that felt healthier than home at the time she has spent the years since supporting his enthusiasm my plan was not for my son to be a broadway star she said my plan was to have a happy well-adjusted child he has played an amazing array of roles the donkey in shrek danny in grease jack in into the woods because over the last few years he has often been doing five shows at a time performing not only at school but also at plaza theatrical productions in lynbrook the rockaway theater company and st gregory’s theater group in queens and broadway workshop in manhattan he has also built a large group of friends from the theater world he met his girlfriend who lives in maryland at broadway workshop he’s the nicest child i’ve ever worked with said marc tumminelli the director of broadway workshop and by being in amazing shows as well as shows that weren’t that great he built his own process so he’s ready the composer of be more chill joe iconis said he met andrew in 2017 when the teenager was performing as roger in a youth theater production of rent that mr iconis’s brother was directing it was truly insane watching that kid sing one song glory as well as i’ve ever heard it sung ever he said he’s some sort of insane musical theater creature who has a preternatural ability to perform the theater company andrew founded called zneefrock after the name andrew made up for the aliens at the now-closed space-themed restaurant mars 2112 began as his bar mitzvah project he wanted to hold a one-night cabaret to raise money for autism research because one of his cousins is on the autism spectrum that evening of les misérables and wicked medleys held at the school theater was so successful drawing theater kids their families and fans that it became an annual event with each one more ambitious and raising more money for charity than the one before there was the star wars parody musical which andrew wrote with a friend a minimalist reimagining of seussical and last summer a production of be more chill yes they managed to stage the show before it arrives on broadway this winter and then most impressively last fall zneefrock staged jason robert brown’s the last five years which is a beloved two-hander about the rise and fall of an unsuccessful marriage with a different gender configuration at each performance boy-girl girl-boy boy-boy and girl-girl to see how the show’s complex romantic dynamic might shift now andrew’s life is all evan he said his house suddenly looks as if it was decorated by ms mindich because there is so much stuff bearing the show’s signature color it’s like everything is blue now he said he has vowed to stop eating dairy hard when chocolate milk is still a dietary staple and started drinking a lot of tea plus water water and water he’s rehearsing up to five hours a day six days a week and he’s thinking about evan who is this person separated from the performances that i’ve seen he asks himself as he delves deeper and deeper into the role i learn a bunch of new things about him every day every rehearsal every time i sit down and look at the script and i’m going to find him

the investigation into the death of journalist jamal khashoggi i am struck by what is not included in mr pompeo’s itinerary the brave women activists of saudi arabia who are being held in the kingdom’s prisons for seeking rights and dignity mr pompeo’s apathy is personal for me because one of the women detained loujain al-hathloul is my sister she has worked relentlessly to earn saudi women the right to drive i live in brussels on may 15 i got a message from my family that loujain had been arrested at my parents house in riyadh where she was living i was shocked and confused because the saudi ban on women driving was about to be removed we could not find out why she was arrested and where she was being held on may 19 the saudi media accused her and the five other arrested women of being traitors a government-aligned newspaper quoted sources predicting the women would get sentences of up to 20 years or even the death penalty loujain was first arrested in december 2014 after she tried to drive from the united arab emirates to saudi arabia she was released after more than 70 days in prison and placed under a travel ban for several months in september 2017 the saudi government announced that the ban on women driving was going to be removed the following june loujain received a call before the announcement from an official in the royal court forbidding her from commenting or talking about it on social media loujain moved to the u.a.e and enrolled into a master’s degree in applied sociological research at sorbonne university’s abu dhabi campus but in march she was pulled over by security officers while driving put on a plane and transferred to a prison in riyadh saudi arabia she was released after a few days but banned from traveling outside the kingdom and warned not to use social media then came her arrest in may i hoped that loujain would be released on june 24 the date for removing the ban on women driving that glorious day arrived and i was delighted to see saudi women behind the wheel but loujain was not released i remained silent hoping my silence might protect her around that time i was struck by a dark trend emerging on social media in saudi arabia anyone who criticized or made a remark on anything related to saudi arabia was labeled a traitor saudi arabia has never been a democracy but it hadn’t been a police state either i kept my thoughts and my grief private between may and september loujain was held in solitary confinement in brief phone calls that she was allowed to make she told us that she was being held in a hotel are you at the ritz-carlton i asked i don’t have the ritz status but it is a hotel she laughed in mid-august loujain was transferred to dhaban prison in jeddah and my parents were allowed to visit her once a month my parents saw that she was shaking uncontrollably unable to hold her grip to walk or sit normally my strong resilient sister blamed it on the air-conditioning and tried to assure my parents that she would be fine after the killing of jamal khashoggi in october i read reports claiming that several people detained by the saudi government at the ritz-carlton in riyadh had been tortured i started getting phone calls and messages from friends and relatives asking if loujain too had been tortured i was shocked by the suggestion i wondered how people could think a woman could be tortured in saudi arabia i believed that social codes of the saudi society would not allow it but by late november several newspapers human rights watch and amnesty international reported that both male and female political and human rights activists in saudi prisons had been tortured some reports mentioned sexual assaults my parents visited loujain at the dhaban prison in december they asked her about the torture reports and she collapsed in tears she said she had been tortured between may and august when she was not allowed any visitors she said she had been held in solitary confinement beaten waterboarded given electric shocks sexually harassed and threatened with rape and murder my parents then saw that her thighs were blackened by bruises saud al-qahtani a top royal adviser was present several times when loujain was tortured she said sometimes mr qahtani laughed at her sometimes he threatened to rape and kill her and throw her body into the sewage system along with six of his men she said mr qahtani tortured her all night during ramadan the muslim month of fasting he forced loujain to eat with them even after sunrise she asked them if they would keep eating all day during ramadan one of his men answered no one is above us not even god a delegation from the saudi human rights commission visited her after the publication of the reports about her torture she told the delegation everything she had endured she asked them if they would protect her we can’t the delegates replied a few weeks later a public prosecutor visited her to record her testimony about torture after the killing of mr khashoggi saudi arabia argued that occasionally officials make mistakes and misuse their power yet we are still waiting for justice i would have preferred to write these words in arabic in a saudi newspaper but after her arrest the saudi newspapers published her name her photographs and labeled her a traitor the same newspapers concealed the names and pictures of the men who could face the death penalty for the murder of mr khashoggi even today i am torn about writing about loujain scared that speaking about her ordeal might harm her but these long months and absence of hope have only increased my desperation to see the travel bans on my parents who are in saudi arabia revoked and to see my brave sister freed alia al-hathloul lives in brussels

2021-02-14T20:57:11.969Z - articleBody received: los angeles more than 30,000 los angeles public-school teachers began a strike on monday the first in three decades in the district holding plastic-covered signs on rain-drenched picket lines across the city they demanded higher pay smaller classes and more support staff in schools the strike effectively shut down learning for roughly 500,000 students at 900 schools in the district the second-largest public school system in the nation the schools remained open staffed by substitutes hired by the city but many parents chose to keep their children at home either out of support for the strike or because they did not want them inside schools with a skeletal staff with negotiations apparently at a standstill the strike could last days or even weeks the decision to walk off the job came after months of negotiations between the teachers union united teachers los angeles and the los angeles unified school district although educators on all sides agree california should spend more money on education the union and the district are locked in a bitter feud about how los angeles should use the money it already gets although district officials have agreed to come closer to meeting some of the union’s demands they say fulfilling all of them would bankrupt the system which is already strained by rising health care and pension costs several democratic politicians voiced their support for the strike monday including senator kamala harris of california who is considering a run for president but gov gavin newsom who took office just a week ago was more measured this impasse is disrupting the lives of too many kids and their families he said in a statement i strongly urge all parties to go back to the negotiating table and find an immediate path forward that puts kids back into classrooms and provides parents certainty the sprawling district goes far beyond the los angeles city limits stretching some 720 square miles from wealthy coastal areas like pacific palisades to working-class southeast suburbs like montebello it is overwhelmingly low income more than 80 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch and latinos make up roughly 75 percent of all students while whites and african-americans each account for less than 10 percent of enrollment on monday we went to schools across the district to talk with teachers on the picket lines as well as the students and parents who joined them at robert f kennedy community schools a large campus in koreatown hundreds of teachers and supporters gathered before sunrise holding signs declaring we demand respect and striking for our students by 8 a.m dozens of students and parents had gathered along the sidewalk to support the teachers but there was also a steady stream of students entering the campus which houses several small schools sophie chiang a 10th-grade student arrived well before the first bell oh god it’s really happening she said as she approached the line of teachers in red ponchos shouting whose schools our schools the campus security guard who is usually at the entrance was not at his post at nearby john burroughs middle school the classrooms mostly sat empty monday roughly 40 percent of the school’s 1,700 students showed up in the morning and were sent to the gymnasium auditorium and multipurpose rooms to work independently on their school-provided ipads a school administrator and substitute teacher were stationed in each large space trying to keep order for hundreds of children we’re trying to make the best learning environment with what we have said steve martinez the school’s principal it’s not an ideal situation mr martinez had asked the district for 65 substitute teachers but received only six by lunchtime the rooms were rowdy but under control though several ipads and phones clearly displayed games that would not be considered educational still matias garcia a sixth-grade student texted his mother asking her to come get him by 11 a.m nobody is listening it’s loud and we spent like an hour taking attendance matias said his mother lilly santaniello works part-time as a lawyer and hired a relative to come take care of her other sons matias said he had a plan for the afternoon video games and sleep jennifer medina in a downpour dozens of teachers wearing ponchos and waving green and red placards we stand with l.a teachers picketed outside the paul revere charter middle school in the pacific palisades neighborhood one teacher waved a large american flag others held bullhorns steven bilek a union representative and math and science teacher at paul revere said that for some teachers the main issue was pay but others were just as concerned with class size or the lack of support staff like librarians or counselors the idea that teachers just want raises is just not true he said paul revere is a charter school affiliated with the district and students attend from more than a hundred zip codes around los angeles he said the school is in one of the city’s wealthiest areas and most if not all of the teachers cannot afford to live nearby i don’t think any of our teachers live in this area mr bilek said we’re lucky to live within an hour some parents and students joined the teachers on the picket line we are here fighting for the future of public education said dennise weir whose children olivia and edward were by her side ms weir lives in beverly hills and can afford private school but she sends her children to public school because she said they are the last civic institutions that are available to everyone there are about 2,100 students enrolled at paul revere but on monday about a third showed up for class each grade was gathered in large assemblies overseen by the few adults on duty substitute teachers campus aides and technicians on a normal day the school has 95 teachers but on monday there were only 10 adults on hand with teaching credentials tim arango union leaders say teaching in the city is unsustainable with salaries far outpaced by a high cost of living large class sizes and not enough resources to help struggling students here’s a look at how los angeles unified compares nationally teacher pay the average teacher salary in los angeles unified was 75,000 during the 2017-2018 school year according to the california department of education far higher than the national average of around 59,000 but los angeles is an expensive place to live when you compare the city with other high-priced urban centers its teacher pay no longer looks so extraordinary the average salary in san francisco last year was 73,000 while new york city teachers earned an average salary of 88,000 according to their union beginning salaries matter too for attracting and retaining young talent in los angeles the entry-level teacher salary was 44,000 last year compared with 47,000 in san francisco and 57,000 in new york city los angeles unified has so far offered teachers a 6 percent raise class size an independent report noted that the two sides can’t agree on how to calculate class size but it is clear that classes in los angeles are big the district has offered to cap classes at 35 students in grades 4-6 39 students in middle and high-school english and math and 32 students at elementary schools that serve many low-income children nationally average class sizes in urban schools ranged between 16 and 28 students depending on grade level and how the school was organized according to the national teacher and principal survey for 2015-2016 professional staff beyond the classroom one of the union’s main demands is for the district to hire more guidance counselors nurses and librarians with increased pressure over the last two decades to raise standardized test scores many public schools have funneled funds into math and reading instruction and suffer from a dearth of such professional staff california’s situation is worse than the national average with more than 600 students per counselor across the state and more than 500 per counselor in los angeles county according to an analysis from the lucile packard foundation for children’s health there are nearly 2,000 students per every school nurse in the county los angeles unified has offered to add an additional academic counselor to each district high school and to make sure each elementary school has daily nursing services the district also offered to ensure library services at each middle school dana goldstein as the final bell sounded at gerald a lawson academy of the arts mathematics and science in south los angeles on monday afternoon striking teachers formed a circle outside the exit and chanted call-and-response songs in the rain a handful of students lingered with their parents singing along susie chavez ducked under a teacher’s umbrella belting out we are the students the mighty mighty students with her arms around her children ms chavez said she would keep bringing them to school no matter how long the strike went on because the teachers are on strike not my kids in the car pool line students in their raincoats packed snugly into cristina aguilar’s s.u.v while she said she supported the strike ms aguilar wanted to avoid creating a truancy record for her younger children in kindergarten and third grade her eldest had stayed home she was taking a wait-and-see approach to school attendance during the strike if there’s no teachers there’s no point in bringing them ms aguilar said louis keene

2021-02-14T21:33:09.639Z - articleBody received: the authorities have charged a suspect with capital murder in the fatal shooting of 7-year-old jazmine barnes as an emotional case that moved the houston community and evoked racial tensions nationwide took an unexpected turn on sunday the authorities identified the suspect eric black jr 20 and said he admitted to taking part in the dec 30 shooting contrary to initial reports that the suspect was white mr black is black it was a revelation that swiftly changed the narrative of a case that had drawn the attention of national civil rights activists amid speculation that the shooting was racially motivated the authorities believe that mr black along with an accomplice thought they were shooting at someone else when they opened fire on jazmine and her family who were in a car on an early morning coffee run this is most likely a case of mistaken identity sheriff ed gonzalez of harris county said at a news conference on sunday but to civil rights activists including shaun king who received the tip that led to the arrest the race of the suspect did not upend the meaning of the case for jazmine’s family or for the country we live in a time where somebody could do something like this based purely on hate or race he said on sunday and that it turned out to not be the case i don’t think changes the devastating conclusion that people had thought something like that was possible the tip named mr black and another man identified by prosecutors by the initials l.w a lawyer for jazmine’s family lee merritt named the second suspect as larry woodruffe 24 who is also black a man with that name was booked into the harris county jail on sunday on a drug possession charge at a hearing to set the bond amount in that case prosecutors said that mr woodruffe was also a suspect in a capital murder investigation and a judge noted that mr woodruffe could possibly face additional charges sheriff gonzalez acknowledged a second person was involved but would not comment on their identity he said the second person had not been charged in jazmine’s death as of sunday afternoon but said that charges could be filed lawyers for the men could not be immediately reached for comment on sunday hundreds gathered this weekend to honor jazmine and fight for justice in her case read more about the rally here the capital murder charge filed against mr black came after a weeklong search in a case that seemed to offer few clues jazmine was with her mother and three sisters just before 7 a.m when the authorities said a man in a truck pulled up beside them and began shooting a bullet struck jazmine in the head and she died at the scene the authorities said the authorities released grainy images of a red pickup truck and a sketch of the suspect describing him as a thin white man in his 30s or 40s sheriff gonzalez said there was indeed a red pickup truck that came to a stop at a traffic signal next to jazmine and her family near a walmart in the houston area where the shooting happened but the authorities now believe that driver could be a witness to the shooting jazmine was with her mother laporsha washington and her sisters including a 6-year-old and two teenagers the authorities said ms washington who was injured in the shooting told cnn she did not see the gunman but her teenage daughter described him as a white man with blue eyes this just went down very quickly sheriff gonzalez said when the gunfire erupted we are talking about small children they witnessed something very traumatic and it’s very likely the last thing they did see was that red truck and the driver in that truck research has shown that stress levels and conditions at the time of a crime can undercut the accuracy of eyewitness identification the sheriff and the family said the sun had not yet risen when the shooting happened eyewitness testimony is the least reliable evidence you can have said lori brown a criminologist at meredith college in north carolina who said that people generally try to understand how a traumatic event could have happened by using what they know about the world unfortunately she said we fill in the gaps after jazmine’s killing the public mobilized to help the family on saturday the day before the arrest was announced nearly 1,000 people gathered at a rally in houston clutching banners and shouting for justice for jazmine who was in second grade at a houston-area school deandre hopkins a wide receiver for the houston texans had pledged to donate his paycheck from this weekend’s playoff game which amounts to 29,000 to help pay for jazmine’s funeral and mr king a prominent racial justice activist and a columnist at the intercept had raised a 100,000 reward for information leading to the gunman’s arrest mr king who has five children including a 6-year-old daughter said he did not get involved in the case because he thought the gunman was white i internalized the pain of the family and tried to search as if it were my own child who was killed he said he said he would move forward with distributing the reward money to the anonymous tipster should the person claim it whether it fits the direction people thought the case was going or not he said it took tremendous courage for somebody to report this mr merritt the civil rights attorney who is representing the family said he was glad that the racial implications of the case were taken seriously and that jazmine’s death got widespread attention but it shouldn’t only be weaponized for political purposes when the suspected killer is white he said the whole movement of black lives matter is about the attention and care that is given to people of color in the face of violence mr merritt said that while the arrest came as a surprise to jazmine’s family it also came as a relief as they mourned and prepared for her burial on tuesday they didn’t want a white person to be prosecuted he said they wanted the right person to be prosecuted

2021-02-14T21:33:09.683Z - articleBody received: new haven frank ricci a veteran firefighter was apprehensive when he heard that yale repertory theater was planning a play based on the lawsuit that bore his name a legal case bitterly fought all the way to the supreme court but i figured it would be in my best interest to participate he said recently so at least part of our story could be told he was referring to conversations that form the basis of good faith four chats about race and the new haven fire department which begins performances feb 1 at the theater and may well rekindle debates that divided this city mr ricci a battalion chief and union leader who has been on the new haven force for 21 years suspected the play would have a liberal slant but was untroubled in the end he said we still won the case in 2009 the supreme court ruled in a 5-to-4 decision that the city violated the civil rights of a group of largely white firefighters including mr ricci when it set aside the results of a 2003 exam for promotion in which they had scored highest administrators including the mayor at the time john destefano jr argued they were simply trying to comply with a federal law that views job requirements like promotional tests with suspicion when they disproportionately rule out minority applicants after a suggestion by a yale law professor that the case and its implications under a trump administration could make compelling theater yale rep commissioned the playwright karen hartman to write about it for the stage rather than a courtroom drama she took a documentary theater approach la the laramie project drawing on interviews with the actual participants in events her play joins a growing list of research-based dramas dealing with race and class in america from anna deavere smith’s monologues to lynn nottage’s pulitzer prize-winning sweat in good faith ms hartman said she aimed to shed light on real lives caught between competing legal principles for the people who were involved in this case she said it disrupted and derailed their lives certainly for a time and in some ways for all times this was so divisive it’s hard for people to talk about it still the play also allowed her to talk about race in a small american city with big city issues new haven’s population of 130,000 is 34 percent black 31 percent white and 27 percent hispanic over four years of research ms hartman who lived in new haven in the 90s while a graduate playwriting student at yale school of drama sat in on training sessions at the fire academy rode in fire trucks and hung out among first responders the conversations were revelatory she said they were charged and real and honest in a way that i’ve never seen before in conversations about race what i want the play to convey is the possibility of communication around race and fairness and to some degree class in an american city those are the big themes the play is presented as a series of chats ms hartman’s deliberately chosen nonthreatening word in the years following the verdict centering mainly around four first-name-only characters two african-american firefighters a white firefighter and a white female lawyer with a fifth character representing the playwright i am in a sense the audience someone trying to figure things out following my nose and going with what was interesting to me ms hartman explained she knew she would be initially seen as an outsider a liberal white woman artist swanning in with all of the assumptions that come with that and her expectations were not mistaken but concern about how ms hartman’s narrative will be presented came from both sides if she doesn’t take advantage and understand these long-term stakes of the case that’s a lost opportunity said robert post the yale law school professor who first suggested that the case could be theatricalized race in america is not a question of melodrama it’s a question of drama which is to say complicated issues that are hard to understand the play does not go into detail on the many trials and spinoff cases that ate up some 10 years said jennifer kiger director of new play programs at yale’s binger center for new theater which helped in its development but it does talk about race she added it does talk about discrimination it does talk about the legal matters but from a very personal point of view kenny leon the tony award-winning director who is staging good faith feels those issues personally as an african-american man living in america in 2019 it strikes me as a very important piece he said connecting the lawsuit to a desperate attempt of some in the country to diffuse this wave of diversity that is our future race and class divides go beyond the firehouse according to ms hartman and the play also explores how members of elite liberal institutions show unconscious bias when making assumptions about merit that was a big thing that emerged she said the 2016 election of donald trump whose victory depended on the anxiety of the white working class led the playwright back to new haven to continue her conversations and mr post and others said they hoped that the implications of a supreme court shaped under a trump administration come out and remain plain in the play michael briscoe an african-american former firefighter went on to challenge the city’s testing process following the 2009 court decision he said he hopes the play which features a character based on him has a unifying message when you talk about diversity a lot of times we’re highlighting the differences in people and not the things that are the same and that bring us together he said that’s how you move in a civil way forward in this country you’ve got to listen and speak to people who look and sound different from you he was among the firefighters invited to a reading before rehearsals last month man it was kind of cool he reported they are really my words that capture how i feel about certain things and the fact that it is going to be in a play was interesting intriguing exciting even mr ricci on the other hand hasn’t yet seen the play but he is dubious about the role of yale while he acknowledged that the university’s law school has produced conservative judges some great ones too like clarence thomas the drama school is another place entirely while cautiously optimistic about the play as a whole he’s not hopeful about how he’ll be portrayed he expects he said to be played as the equivalent of brett kavanaugh on saturday night live james bundy yale rep’s artistic director said it is only through the difficult conversations enacted in the play that viewers can develop empathy with those on the other side of wrenching political issues for us to experience any change in our society that’s truly meaningful he said we’re going to have to work through the discomfort in a divided city in a divided nation will people approach each other with good faith ms hartman said the phrase was used by subjects on both sides of the fire department debate the title is not quite ironic she said but aspirational everyone says they want to be working in good faith the play asks can

2021-02-14T21:33:09.762Z - articleBody received: late one november evening in her oslo apartment the norwegian novelist linn ullmann told me a terrific story we had been speaking for four days in the apartment in her writing studio in restaurants and taxis on the streets of oslo about her life and her art we had surveyed the 20 years she has spent writing novels the latest and sixth unquiet appears in the united states this week novels that have made her a household name in scandinavia and are published in 35 languages we had traced her winding path from birth in oslo to a succession of schools in new york city juilliard when she was dancing professional children’s school when she was modeling new york university when she was pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees in literature a city where she supposed she would make her life and we had discussed ullmann’s return to oslo where now 52 she has lived for 30 years and raised four children with her husband the poet novelist and playwright niels fredrik dahl the terrific story she told me that evening involved her late father and a phone call he made toward the end of his life ullmann’s telling of it was occasioned by a question i asked about long marriages what she thought helped them flourish and endure she and her husband married nearly 20 years have a gentle way with each other dahl’s hand would briefly come to rest on ullmann’s shoulder ullmann’s feet would find dahl’s lap at the end of a dinner party the terrific story ullmann told about her father and the phone call spoke sweetly and i thought meaningfully to that question and yet it was also ullmann made clear when she came to its conclusion as far as she was concerned not a terrific story rather an anecdote one of many she has accumulated across her long unusual life but it was not the sort of story that she tells in public more important it was not the sort of story she exploits in her fiction i can’t stand anecdotes ullmann said cross-legged on her couch beneath a framed alexander calder lithograph her voice rising at the end of her sentence as if to chase the final word away how do you define them a story she said that’s good for dinner parties i have thousands such stories can be charming i offered that ullmann made clear was the problem there was an old danish poet ullmann said her fluent english inflected with round norwegian vowels whom i interviewed in my early 20s he and i talked about up-and-coming danish writers what about this writer what about that writer this one he said would be good if she wasn’t so charming a writer ought not to be charming he was speaking of the person or their prose the prose ullmann said pausing i don’t want my writing to be charming i asked what that meant at an aesthetic level anecdotes ullmann said resigning herself to picking the word up again elicit a kind of soft response sweet applause an anecdote is told many times honed in a certain way so that if it has a rough edge even that is absolutely palatable it might elicit tears a little ah i suggested that the story about her father and the phone call managed to do more it was in unquiet she said as if to half agree recrossing her legs smoothing her short blond hair it was in an early draft you cut it i cut it i knew i had to cut it niels told me to cut it geir geir gulliksen one of norway’s leading novelists and ullmann’s editor of 20 years told me to cut it everyone said it’s a sweet story it’s lovely it’s charming and she said rearranging herself on the couch once again you should cut it too from the piece that is it was like many of our conversations not on the record but a way of illustrating a point and she would not be giving me permission to print it which ullmann went on will make the piece better everyone will wonder what the anecdote was most readers at least those in scandinavia came to ullmann’s writing 25 years ago knowing full well what the anecdotes were they couldn’t not the anecdotes preceded her followed her follow her still as gulliksen said when i visited him at the offices of forlaget oktober where he is publisher and where his editorial responsibilities have narrowed through the years mainly to ullmann dahl and karl ove knausgaard if you want to be a writer a serious writer it’s not a good thing for you to be the daughter of those people linn is the daughter of it’s not a good thing because the moment you try to publish something people will think of you as consider the evidence when ullmann’s first novel before you sleep was published in the united states in 1999 and she stipulated in interviews that she would not respond to questions about her parents her father the filmmaker ingmar bergman her mother the actress liv ullmann the headline of the review in the new york times nonetheless punned on a title of one of her father’s films in which her mother acted or consider the headline of the review of her third novel grace in the times in 2005 which was not a pun on a title of one of her father’s films but the actual title of one of her father’s actual films and as it happens the very same film the earlier review had already punned on or consider that in every review of her novels in the times not merely the first when she was 33 or the second when she was 37 or the third when she was 38 or the fourth when she was 42 or the fifth when she was 47 the names of her famous parents were not occasionally but always mentioned not infrequently in the first paragraphs she was never not viewed presented and considered as fundamentally their child which is to say a child this despite the fact that when she has done interviews throughout her career she has maintained her ban on their discussion and though her six novels differ radically consider that she is often charged vaguely even approvingly but to my mind lazily and therefore condescendingly with being an inheritor of her father’s cinematic themes tendencies and preoccupations the varied forms of ullmann’s autonomous novels have performed the struggles of reconciling the self with a family past how through a story those struggles might be shaped into something tangible if not always beautiful in her second novel stella descending a woman falls from the top of a building perhaps slipping perhaps jumping perhaps pushed by her husband the novel tracing her literal path down to death the narrative built from the monologues of those who witnessed her life’s literal or figurative descent a novel of voices that leaves the woman in perpetual suspension a portrait of the way life can seize someone or ullmann’s fourth a blessed child in which an 84-year-old man a noted gynecologist and researcher announces to his family that he intends to end his life the news compelling his three daughters to make the journey to the distant island where he lives alone the daughters mulling their lives and their losses as they approach the women never making it to the island the book enacting in its form how we often try to avoid where we came from throughout ullmann’s novels you encounter dominating and disappearing fathers distant heavy-drinking mothers narcissistic husbands unfaithful partners children whose adult lives of disappointment and error are visited by violence rape murder the death of children events that metaphorically reveal the inner violence humans try to navigate they are not autobiographical in any obvious sense there are no famous film-director fathers there are no movie-star mothers and the fates of her characters are inventions not reports from the field i was aware of ullmann’s lineage but in fairness i was not a devotee of either her father’s four dozen films or of his three novels nor an aficionado of her famously beautiful mother’s performances in some of her father’s and in many other movies not to say of her mother’s two memoirs or her own films as a director rather i came to oslo as an admirer of ullmann’s novels their formal variety and daring their commitment to seeking out the rough edges of the world their complexity in presenting emotion in duress their fraught depictions of childhood’s perils their originality in dramatizing the particular struggles of young women their unflinching ability to depict moments of violence the rigor and surprise of their sentences but i was interested to know how an artistic ego as autonomous and fully realized as ullmann’s had managed to form despite as gulliksen said her being the daughter of those people with those famous names it was very important gulliksen told me that she was a critic before she was a novelist we haven’t had a critic like her afterward speak to writers in norway as i did and a clear consensus forms ullmann was the most important literary critic of her generation a james wood of norwegian writing unable to read norwegian i wanted to know what that meant you understood that every time she wrote about a book gulliksen explained she didn’t only write about the book but she wrote about how to read about what it can mean in a broader context she could write about roland barthes in a way that everybody could feel oh i have to read this writer so she was providing access to great literature in a very organic and convincing way and she wrote about young norwegian writers important at that time because we needed it so she did both and it was very important that she was that kind of critic before she started publishing novels she convinced the literary community that she was something when ullmann began publishing novels she stopped writing literary criticism but her books instant best sellers in scandinavia spoke in a deep way with other writers in translation i felt a sense of kinship with her generationally the novelist rachel cusk born a year after ullmann told me by phone i also felt a quality i would identify as her permission to express herself having come from weirdly a place that i felt rather familiar with even though you know i’m not the child of internationally renowned artists looking back cusk continued i wonder whether what i identified with in her voice was the feeling of the dominated daughter a woman under parental authority which is very much my persona whether consciously or unconsciously as well i guess what i feel in my own work is that i too have by a very different route come to a position of authority and got out from under upbringing and i don’t always hear a note of upbringing or don’t often hear it in the writing of my female contemporaries ullmann’s latest book marks a departure her precise lean cadenced sentences remain but gone are the metaphorical narrative frameworks that defined her earlier work gone the furniture-selling or book-editing or gynecology-practicing fathers gone the devastating instances of externalized violence rather and for the first time ullmann has formed a book out of the explicit landmarks of her lived life her childhood as the daughter of those people looking at them through the prism of what ullmann can recall of her complicated upbringing if the backs of her books always hid from view any mention of her family past the new book foregrounds it in norway the cover of the novel featured a photograph of ullmann age 12 sitting next to her father the form of the book however isn’t documentary but rather fragmentary the way memory is moments rising up seemingly unbidden and then sinking only to rise into view again to be looked at from another perspective in time at the beginning ullmann writes if there were such a thing as a telescope that could be trained on the past i could have said look that’s us let’s find out what really happened and every time we began to doubt whether what i remember is true or what you remember is true or whether what happened really happened or whether we even existed we could have stood side by side and looked into the telescope together ullmann’s you applies equally to the book’s parents as to its child three beings lost to time within that textual attempt at seeing remembering and comprehending are a curious set of found artifacts the transcripts of a series of recordings that ullmann made of conversations between her and her father very late in his life conversations during which she and he were to explore the matter of growing old and once completed and using the tapes as source material father and daughter were to have collaborated on a book but owing to the father’s decline they became something else a reckoning with loss while her father was alive ullmann’s other books are filled with voices with shifts in point of view but the voice of the father in unquiet feels different not a creation so much as a kind of visitation thus the book became in part about her father’s death a death that allowed her to write the story of her life of her parents love and of her own for them it’s a subject gulliksen told me she has been avoiding denying herself the possibility of even thinking about because she always feels that she has to tell people i’m a grown-up person and i’m a writer i’m not the daughter of anyone in unquiet the parents have no names rather designations pappa or sometimes the father a filmmaker mamma or sometimes the mother an actress ullmann alternating freely between first person and third sometimes saying i but at other times writing about the girl as here on her father’s home hammars on faro an island in the baltic sea lots of things were dangerous all the usual things of course like putting a plastic bag over your head death by suffocation walking around in wet underpants swimsuits or bikini bottoms death by bladder infection twisting a tick the wrong way when detaching it from the skin death by blood poisoning going swimming less than an hour after eating death by cramps accepting rides from strangers death by kidnapping rape murder taking candy from strangers death by poisoning possibly kidnapping rape murder but there were also other dangers specific to hammars never touch the flotsam that washed up on the beach below the house liquor bottles packs of cigarettes shampoo bottles tin cans with labels in foreign languages foreign lettering don’t touch don’t sniff and for god’s sake don’t drink death by poisoning don’t sit in a draft death by catching a cold don’t catch a cold death by expulsion from hammars don’t sit in the drying closet death by suffocation possibly electrocution don’t be late if you showed up late death would be a consolation death was if anything the only valid excuse for a lack of punctuality give this girl a map and she’ll follow it she doesn’t break a single rule except the one about not sitting in the closet ingrid had told her over and over again but still the girl sneaked in to be enveloped by the warmth until the day she found a sheet of yellow notebook paper taped to the closet-door on which the father had written in big block capitals warning it is strictly forbidden for swimming children to frequent the drying closet the 184-word runaway train of a sentence at the heart of this passage tracks the path of parental prohibitions through the girl’s mind though the threats are grave the touch is light and the accumulated effect is one that believably conveys the feeling dreadful delightful of a child’s point of view the clarity and lack of fetter is characteristic of ullmann’s way of seeing the world in prose and in this case of seeing the self as a third person though an unusual storytelling strategy this third-person self is not unprecedented in the annals of autobiographical writing henry adams the historian and descendant of two american presidents great-grandson of john adams and grandson of john quincy adams in his posthumously published autobiography refers to himself throughout and only as he and yet ullmann makes clear that unquiet isn’t an autobiography rather a novel and so i wondered about ullmann’s choice to elide these central names she said it was informed by a moment from marcel proust’s 1.5-million-word first-person autobiographical novel in search of lost time proust wrote about himself ullmann said but his narrator only gives his name in one scene the sentence appears in the novel’s fifth volume the prisoner as the narrator greets albertine the woman he’s living with and tran2021-02-14T21:33:09.762Z - END of articleBody
slates thus once she was able to speak again she said my or my darling either one followed by my christian name which in giving the narrator the same name as that of the author of this book made for my marcel my darling marcel why did proust make the choice to have his narrator give his name only then in all those pages ullmann referred me to another moment in proust’s novel he has this scene she said animatedly as if she had just put the book down when he’s going to one of the parties and they call his name and he’s really really dreading it the usher asked me my name i said it mechanically like someone condemned to death putting his neck on the block instantly majestically he raised his head and before i could ask him to announce me without fanfare he shouted the disquieting syllables with a force that could shake the roof of the hall the disquieting syllables ullmann said pausing as her words rang out that was very meaningful to me i was going to write about disquieting syllables this gave her she said some freedom a freedom to be found novelistically although she was writing from her life what she was putting on the page wasn’t reportorial evidence rather characters even if she was writing a scene based in what she could recall she allowed herself to inhabit the moment telescopically to see with the imagination what was no longer there she gave herself the freedom to imagine what had been forgotten not in an attempt to establish facts beyond her conversations with her father during his decline she did no research but to find the truth that quarry the novel has always in its paradoxical way sought and seized even so many serious writers have complicated feelings about such categorical claims about what a novel is in a comment in the times literary supplement that accompanied the writer lydia davis’s choice of unquiet for her book of the year davis when referring to it put quotation marks around the word novel the use of the term novel davis told me in an email for something very closely autobiographical the perfect example of course being knausgaard’s six-book my struggle is further expanding our definition of novel which is all to the good to me these books and linn ullmann’s unquiet excellent though they are do not fit the older more customary definition of novel even though that definition encompasses so many kinds of novel autobiographical but traditional novels with conventionally arranged scenes dialogue landscape description and more formal less personal narrative commentary would be closer to the traditional fictional novel on the continuum and these novels of knausgaard and ullmann closer to the memoir i wondered if davis objected to the word novel for ullmann’s enterprise i do think knausgaard and ullmann have every right to call what they have written novels she said but i would guess that most of the material in the books in both cases is retrieved from memory no substantial material invented and only the dialogue perhaps recreated as a fictional construct i understand too that the fact of labeling it a novel does not just give ullmann permission to recreate with more freedom what she may imperfectly remember but also removes the story to a greater distance that may make it easier to see objectively and shape dramatically cusk had her own sense of what made ullmann’s novelistic practice notable metaphysically i think unquiet is an object lesson in the moral use of material cusk told me and because linn’s material is in the public realm to a degree she can teach that lesson it’s impossible for me to explain to people that i don’t in my work violate my children’s privacy or do all the things i’m accused of because nobody knows it’s my private life whereas in linn’s case precisely how she uses a moral code in relation to her material can be dissected and examined if her life was anonymous if these parents and their child were anonymous i don’t think one would necessarily know how clever a book it is when most novelists mine their lived lives only their unfortunate friends and family are the wiser when ullmann does the reader in addition to experiencing a novel also witnesses a public navigation through or a performance of the risks inherent in all fiction that it misuses the real ullmann was willing to talk to me at some length and with great candor about her life outside the borders she had drawn to contain her novel but much of what ullmann said to me was off the record part of this was as i said at the outset her absolute prohibition on the inclusion of anecdotes anecdotes she either cut from unquiet or didn’t bother putting in in the first place it was not that ullmann was being evasive rather frank and principled these things were hers for her to keep or for her to use and yet this lent my attempt to profile her a somewhat surreal and at the very least awkward interior weather for central to the success that ullmann achieves in unquiet is a sort of proof that the only way to write meaningfully about another person’s life is to move beyond the borders of the known world to its unimaginable interior to write fiction even so on a sunday afternoon i sat down with ullmann in her writing studio to talk the room is a little apartment that ullmann rents on the top floor of the building into which she and dahl and their teenage daughter and their dog moved in the fall their eldest three children from each of their first marriages now grown the family’s need for the larger house where they had been living now past the studio i began to say is spare the bookshelves not full albeit with a tidy line of books by virginia woolf in arm’s reach of ullmann’s desk they were the first things i unpacked windows ring the room and through them you could appreciate in all its pallor oslo in november 1 p.m and through the long french windows with their view of the terra-cotta rooflines and the ordered rows of ancient trees planted harmoniously in the park below the gray lid of sky was already beginning to dim ullmann turned on a light asked if i was warm enough if i needed something more to drink if i was comfortable in the hard chair or would i prefer the ergonomic one as i began i told her that i was going to ask her a great many questions i believed i already had answers to i thought that i had those answers because to an extent in the weird way that children of celebrities are she is a public figure of whom there are photographs online as a child holding her mother’s hand on the red carpet as her date at the academy awards looking as though she wished she could tap her heels three times and moreover i thought that i had those answers because ullmann has written in unquiet that strangest of things not a novel that feels like fact but one that renders facts like my questions moot not fake but illuminatingly frail weak beside the fiction fiction from a latin root fingere to form what was i going to make of her life that ullmann hasn’t already fashioned as i posed my questions questions a friend of mine once said are a great way of avoiding information a sentiment i once didn’t understand but that now seems like the most sensible thing anyone has ever said it began to feel to me as though on the roof of my mind a large bird were clattering loudly across it clumsily advancing claws scraping tiles flapping its wings distracting my ability to it’s a sea gull ullmann said sorry on the roof ullmann pointed to the ceiling it’s a gull he lives up here i don’t know why we’re quite far from the sea but he’s been here since we moved in nothing to be worried about are you cold shall we go downstairs the few things i salvaged from those hours that you won’t find better told felt formed in unquiet ullmann’s maternal grandmother was a bookseller middle class hard working she gave her granddaughter books throughout her childhood ullmann’s father after her parents split up after her father withdrew to a life of making films and living on faro a little swedish island in the baltic sea would have his daughter spend a month with him in summers he read to her patiently ullmann says the great swedish children’s books he was in love with astrid lindgren ullmann said we didn’t read pippi longstocking but these others the brothers lionheart mio my son who else tove jansson maria gripe who is another even darker but beautiful swedish novelist for young people but beautiful dark stuff he would read and i just loved it and once i do remember that i read for him we were in my little bedroom and i had just started reading so i was probably about 5 or 6 or something and that i was going to read for him i don’t remember what it was and that he sat and i remember this is how i remember it i remember that he sat and that i was doing really well and that he was superinterested and that when i was finished he said it was wonderful and then somehow the question of how long we’d been sitting there came up and he said oh just two hours so this is how i remember it that he was patient and that he would actually listen listen of her mother ullmann said a good deal magnificent was the word she used later on another day ullmann asked that i not make too much of the fact that when she did speak about her mother at moments she grew moved in a visible way a way that made us both fall quiet before we proceeded not everybody has a magnificent parent i said that day no a long pause before well she really is what does that mean ullmann sighed not delightedly sorry i said and ullmann laughed i’d arranged to meet ullmann in another part of oslo at the house where she and dahl and their children lived for six years they sold it the previous winter the new owners were due to take possession in two weeks ullmann and dahl were completing the process of emptying it the house was the end unit in a little outpost of long four-family homes built at the turn of the century stout vaguely scandinavian for that is how they seemed townhouses designed for factory workers but absorbed by an upwardly mobile middle class out front was a garden with rose bushes still in bloom along with an apple tree hung with colorful frozen fruit beneath which dozed the family dog gray muzzle perched on paws ullmann had yet to arrive but her husband was within trying to conclude the complicated business of dispersal dahl was taking to the task with some real pleasure i have not said that dahl has published five novels and is now also a household name in norway i have not said that ullmann when she saw him for the first time said that she thought he was the most gorgeous man she’d ever seen ullmann arrived she and dahl discussed the progress that had been made a bit of domestic theater ensued as they talked about which of the remaining pieces of furniture would be put into storage which sold among the chattels were two desks one his one hers extras from a summer house they let go dahl suggested that ullmann part with hers given that she had a desk in the studio but that was my first desk she said she had it in new york but you don’t use it ullmann suggested that dahl part with his but it’s beautiful they decided to keep both during our conversations before that moment ullmann had repeatedly referenced her field i went to my field this morning i did not have time to go to my field today perhaps we should go to my field tomorrow so repeatedly had the field come up it had taken on for me a mystical charge so ullmann took me there replicating the walk she took from this house nearly every day for six years ullmann walks briskly even bundled as she was in a bulky parka of such immensity as to make you suppose that were she to fall help would be required to right her we walked briskly through the peak light of the day past a day care where children played outdoors and arrived at the field which was a track around a soccer field it’s nothing special ullmann said it’s just my field do you want to walk around it we walked around it i very aware that this following along in her footsteps was both a true thing and a false thing here was where she came to think to feel herself unwind from the writing and to be wound again to write more there was nothing for me to see or to feel rather only to imagine and the limits of my imagination in that moment were finite then i saw the pigeons a great flock of them in the middle of the field rising like a little dark cloud falling back to earth could you walk out there i said this to ullmann who complied i should mention that i was carrying around a rather large film camera with which i’d taken pictures of the city and of ullmann now and again just walk out and you know ullmann did raised her hands as she approached a conductor poised for the downbeat the birds like one body rose i sit now looking at the photograph it’s a nice picture it shows the gray lid of the sky and the little line of scandinavian buildings and a soccer goal and the cloud of rising birds and the back of a woman bundled up arms raised conducting you cannot see her face and in that way i like it it does nothing to reveal her

2021-02-14T21:33:09.984Z - articleBody received: last summer a federal judge in san diego said the trump administration treated immigrant children detained at the border worse than chattel the unfortunate reality wrote judge dana sabraw in ordering a halt to president trump’s policy of separating the children from their parents is that under the present system migrant children are not accounted for with the same efficiency and accuracy as property that was underscored on thursday when the inspector general of the department of health and human services released a report revealing that thousands more children than previously disclosed may have been torn from their parents for months before the policy was even announced the report confirmed that as the number of families seeking asylum has soared the true crisis on the border was a humanitarian one that the administration’s actions have made far worse the report said department officials who care for immigrant children seized at the border realized by august 2017 that the proportion of children separated from their parents was 10 times greater than had previously been the case when families were usually broken up only if there were safety concerns for the children it was not until the following april that the administration announced a zero-tolerance approach under which families would be pulled apart because all adults crossing the border without authorization would be criminally charged and jailed in an accounting that resulted from judge sabraw’s order stemming from a legal challenge brought by the american civil liberties union the government acknowledged that nearly 3,000 children had been separated from their parents since the policy was announced but on top of that the inspector general said thousands more may not have been counted over all the total number of children separated at the border is unknown according to the report nor was it clear how many of these children had yet to be reunited with their families judge sabraw was right when he wrote that the government’s responses to the chaos it caused belie measured and ordered governance which is central to the concept of due process enshrined in our constitution this is particularly so in the treatment of migrants many of whom are asylum seekers and small children the report describes department officials essentially grasping in the dark to come to terms with what had happened because the tracking systems in use at that time were informal and designed for operational purposes according to the report immigration officials were unable to provide a more precise estimate or specific information about these children’s placements department officials had to search more than 60 databases to identify indicators of possible separation such as an adult and child with the same last name apprehended on the same day at the same location officials also had to review 12,000 case files and contact the department’s shelters to find children who had been separated from their families in a report released in october the department of homeland security's inspector general found its computers had been unable to track family members who had been separated such dysfunction goes beyond mere incompetence to have so little regard for the damage done to so many children for the heartache caused to so many parents is to indulge in callousness if not deliberate cruelty president trump doesn’t need a wall he needs a heart follow the new york times opinion section on facebook twitter nytopinion and instagram

2021-02-14T21:33:10.252Z - articleBody received: second of two articles when a filmmaker pulls back the camera lens to capture the widest possible image it’s called a full frame can social service agencies adopt a similar frame can they shift from a focus on isolated needs safety housing health or employment in favor of a broad view that supports human well-being last week i explored the kinds of problems that are created when services try to tackle individual needs in isolation i looked at how an organization called the full frame initiative had developed a framework based on five domains of well-being safety mastery stability social connectedness and meaningful access to relevant resources this article looks at how the full frame initiative is partnering with government agencies in missouri and massachusetts to integrate this well-being orientation at the system level the goal is to demonstrate possibilities for system change that could improve social services across the country in missouri the full frame initiative has been working with state agencies since 2010 since 2011 one of its partners the division of youth services which is responsible for the care and treatment of youths committed to its custody by juvenile courts has seen improvements in the academic progress educational completion and law-abiding rates of youths served more recently the full frame initiative has been working with st louis’s family courts since 2016 i found its approach very restorative said ben burkemper the family court administrator for st louis county it addresses the whole person not just the offense that the juvenile committed all humans strive to have meaningful gas in all five domains mr burkemper said the key is not to force unsustainable trade-offs he offered the example of a juvenile who is placed on probation and ordered by the court to attend group counseling two evenings a week while unbeknown to the court his mother a single parent is working two jobs and needs to have her son take care of his siblings on those evenings or risk losing one of her jobs instead of just saying you have to make it work mr burkemper said the court looks at the youth and his family holistically o.k you can’t make the sessions on these evenings we’ll try to find something for you during the day through another agency this approach seems sensible how does it benefit society to force a youth to comply with a court order that imperils his family’s economic security even if he has committed a crime but it takes a culture change to make the system work this way for family court to avoid forcing trade-offs like these the front-line staff must understand the family’s situations in significant detail mr burkemper said and they must be supported by managers and supervisors who prioritize long-term well-being over short-term responses so when mr burkemper began advancing this framework in the family court he recruited the full frame initiative to train high-level staff members while enlisting deputy juvenile officers to develop new assessment forms and procedures in line with the five-domains approach they were the ones who would be dealing with cases every day so it was essential that they felt they owned the new processes even if it took a year and a half to roll it all out the changes initially met with some resistance he said but now staff members say the new approach humanizes families and also saves time we’re seeing more clearly how hard it can be for families to comply with court-ordered conditions not because they are unmotivated or resistant but because of poverty safety and other considerations michelle frank a deputy juvenile officer in the investigations unit of the st louis county family court said the new assessment process begins by focusing on strengths ms frank said an officer might start by asking what are you proud of about your child rather than jumping into the problems when a kid and his family walk into our office they’re guarded she added the first few moments of that interview are so important to get their buy-in if it’s done right you get to more of the depth of what’s going on more depth makes it more likely that court orders will work for instance some juveniles fail to attend their court-mandated counseling sessions because it means traveling on bus lines that pass through areas that are dangerous for them a suspicious youth may be reluctant to share that information now court officers are more likely to discover this concern during their assessments and they can respond by trying to bring programs into neighborhoods where youths live if a juvenile’s offense involves drugs it’s common for the court to require participation in a drug program but an assessment may reveal that a youth’s ambition is to get a job instead we’ll have them start with a job program ms frank said this gives them more of a sense of control and when they get the job they realize they have to be clean the five-domains approach can reveal the logic behind behaviors that may look like nothing more than teenage recklessness or delinquency all behavior meets a need linda snyder a deputy juvenile officer in the family services unit of the st louis county family court said so whether that behavior is adaptive or maladaptive you have to understand the need it is filling a juvenile she said may persist with behaviors that keep her in detention because it meets her need for safety better than being at home or a student may continue cursing out a teacher because getting kicked out of class serves to avoid the embarrassment of having to read in front of his peers or a youth who uses drugs may do so mainly to satisfy the need for social connectedness at the end of the day negative consequences don’t change behavior ms snyder said change comes through teaching competencies and incentivizing and celebrating accomplishments what the full frame does is teaches a process for developing interventions that are going to create competencies that will decrease the likelihood that kids will continue to be system involved the officers in the family court can act with confidence on their insights because they are working in a system where everyone shares a common language mr burkemper said in massachusetts the full frame initiative has been working for eight years with five state agencies with the goal of preventing survivors of domestic and sexual violence from becoming or remaining homeless often for victims of domestic violence there’s a forced trade-off said tammy mello the former executive director of the governor’s council to address sexual and domestic violence in massachusetts several years ago ms mello and other department heads who focused on children and families transitional assistance housing and homelessness public health and victims assistance began meeting periodically to figure out how their systems could become better aligned in particular they wanted to stop making things harder for people who were trying to stabilize their lives for example if a mother experiencing domestic violence lost temporary custody of her children because the child welfare department determined that they had to be removed for safety it would automatically trigger her loss of housing benefits it was crazy ms mello said then you couldn’t return the kids to the mom because she’d lost her housing and the mother would say i can’t get housing assistance unless i have my kids back that’s where the five domains came in ms mello added we embraced the idea that although we work in systems with different mandates we could rally around this framework that’s intended to look at what every human being needs to have overall well-being in massachusetts getting alignment on the well-being framework has required a different approach than in missouri for the full frame initiative it has meant working with an array of state agencies that set standards and policies as well as with numerous nonprofit agencies that actually provide services for people facing domestic violence or homelessness but the well-being orientation is gaining ground two years ago the state re-procured all of its sexual and domestic violence services 40 million per year for 11 years explicitly focusing on well-being and equity not just on short-term safety said katya smyth the full frame initiative’s founder this has allowed nonprofits for whom this approach makes sense to really lean in and operationalize it because the incentives and expectations of the government are aligned with what makes sense to them now five state agencies have come together to pilot an approach to supporting survivors of violence in need of housing that is based on the well-being framework linn torto the executive director of the interagency council on housing and homelessness in massachusetts said via email the same crosscutting focus on well-being she added is being applied in the development of a new 200 million procurement for the family shelter system what’s revolutionary about this ms smyth said is that it is setting up structures that enable the agencies to focus on what is best for the families rather than on their own individual mandates in addition to its demonstration projects with government systems the full frame initiative is also developing an institute to work with community activists to bring a well-being orientation to their work solving local problems the organization has also begun exploring the implications for medicine for older adults we’re seeing an epidemic of depression which we’re treating medically as depression said dr rachel broudy who recently joined the full frame initiative as director of health care transformation after practicing geriatric medicine for 13 years is some of this loneliness a lack of purpose or not having a place to give back to society or a loss of stability for older adults the big thing we focus on is safety but what does that mean in terms of loss of agency stability or community in medicine we take away so many routines from people if all we did was try to create equitable access to well-being and do no harm it would change medicine dramatically this work isn’t just about better outcomes for individuals ms smyth said it’s about removing systemic barriers that are holding inequities in place so much in our society is built on what we think makes us different from one another this work is about what’s possible when we actually build on and hold our attention on what is universal our needs for well-being

2021-02-14T21:33:13.896Z - articleBody received: thursday puzzle administrivial update thanks to all who have written to let us know about the commenting issue the community team is currently working on it and we thank you for your patience it’s always a pleasure to see a new constructor make a debut in the new york times and today we welcome jeff slutzky who learned the ropes from derek bowman a side note before we look at their puzzle i’d like to reiterate that the best way to get started making crossword puzzles is to find a mentor and to work with that person on polishing skills before submitting work to an editor the learning curve for making crosswords is steep and hard to climb alone still some aspiring constructors avoid this step maybe they want to be left alone to practice on their own or maybe they are sensitive to criticism for whatever reason they avoid working with a pro and find themselves facing a long list of rejection emails whereupon they give up and walk away from a fun hobby and a wonderful community i don’t understand that puzzle editors only have time to give limited feedback when responding to submissions so isn’t it better to have your very own pro to ask questions and work with the puzzle community is a lovely one and i have not met a more helpful crowd o k maybe emergency medical workers are actually more helpful but if you want to learn how to make a puzzle in the most efficient way join the crossword puzzle collaboration directory on facebook and look at the list of veteran constructors who have volunteered their time to help pick one and ask if he or she has time to help you with some of your ideas be patient with veteran constructors time and really listen to what they tell you if they have criticism and i hope it’s gentle and sensible don’t feel bad or get angry at them they are trying to make you a better and hopefully published constructor above all don’t give up mr slutzky worked with mr bowman before submitting his puzzle you can read more about their collaboration in their notes below and look where he is now you could be doing that too and then we could all gather here to say nice things about your puzzle 18a bass group is nice misdirection that fooled me for quite awhile the answer is nsync because the singer lance bass was a founding member 20a til that the nobel prize is not only a shiny medal but also a monetary prize worth 9 million kronor according to xe.com a currency calculator that is worth 1,011,960.43 u.s.d 42a long time out is not referring to being outside your home for a long time it’s talking about being out or unconscious for a long time the answer is coma 49a the entry atf is short for the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives that was added on later and it’s not the answer to group of traffic cops for short because police officers who direct traffic are part of the group the word traffic is being used here in the illegal trafficking sense 50a the gig economy consists of freelance jobs like driving for uber renting property via airbnb or helping others take care of mundane errands via taskrabbit 22d congratulations to the last jedi director rian johnson who is appearing in the new york times crossword for the first time mr slutzky and mr bowman offer us a sound addition theme wherein we are supposed to add tor to the theme entries to give them a different meaning the revealer at 66a the final across entry is torah clued as sacred text or your reaction upon figuring out this puzzle's theme tor ah for example at 21a the answer to the clue kidnapper who gets arrested is captor in hand which is based on the phrase cap in hand jeff slutzky i’m excited to be making my new york times crossword debut it’s my first crossword anywhere actually i first came up with this theme several years ago but i knew nothing about crossword constructing software or word look-up programs at the time so i tried to create the whole puzzle using graph paper my pencil and my brain i didn’t get very far i met derek bowman at the 2018 american crossword puzzle tournament he’s a veteran constructor and when i told him i had a theme idea he expressed interest in collaborating with me he came up with a couple of new theme entries as well as the great torah kicker at the end one of our original entries mentor at work clued as yoda or mr miyagi from 9 to 5 was nixed by the editors because it didn’t really change the meaning of the base phrase so we replaced it with captor in hand derek was great to work with and i learned a lot from him i’m glad we were able to put this puzzle together derek bowman after emailing back and forth a bit after we met we ended up collaborating on this puzzle jeff had several ideas for theme entries that involved adding tor to common phrases and i found them to be very funny it’s raining mentor sadly ended up on the cutting room floor together we eventually narrowed it down to the theme entries listed in the grid with some guidance from will shortz and sam ezersky jeff has a great sense of humor and i’m still amazed that he immediately identified the tune from dear evan hansen that was lovingly redone at the a.c.p.t talent show last year after hearing just a few notes jeff is a whiz at musicals has a keen eye for detail and was a lot of fun to work with on this puzzle almost finished solving but need a bit more help we’ve got you covered warning there be spoilers ahead but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key trying to get back to the puzzle page right here your thoughts
